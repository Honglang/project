You\u2019re a mere mortal in a corporate environment, trying\u00a0to make sense of your data and making rational decisions if possible. \n You make charts all the time, but you don\u2019t really know if this new \u201cdata visualization\u201d is the same thing with a pompous name or is something bigger and\u00a0more complex. Perhaps you could start with a quick image search in Google for \u201c data visualization \u201c. Here is what you\u2019ll get in the first page: \n  \n Wow! Fascinating! But\u2026 is it relevant for you, for your work? Let\u2019s check the prerequisites: \n \n Data types that you don\u2019t have in your work; \n Artistic talent you are not born with; \n programming skills you are not interested in; \n tools your company will never buy. \n \n What\u2019s left? Aesthetic enjoyment as a consumer and little inspiration for a chart maker. \n Is data visualization for you? \n Well, don\u2019t feel excluded from the fascinating world of data visualization just because these results don\u2019t help you in your work. There is a vast silent majority equally\u00a0frustrated! \n Before you return to your simple and boring charts , let me ask you this: do you think that a poetry\u00a0soiree\u00a0is a good sample of how people use their mother tongue? Of course not! These search results are like a poetry\u00a0soiree\u00a0(in the sense of a very specialized use of language). If you just need a functional use of language, poetry may not be your best role model (don\u2019t get me wrong: we need poetry too). \n Is there information visualization without aesthetics? \n One of the data visualization founding fathers, Jacques Bertin, believed that data visualization is an objective set of signs and rules, with no place for aesthetics. I actually disagree, but back then the world was in black and white and it was easier to accept it. You can\u2019t avoid aesthetics. It is\u00a0embedded\u00a0in every single one of your choices when making a chart. \n You can approach data visualization from multiple perspectives, depending on your background, skills or goals. Given the same\u00a0data set, \u00a0a designer, a product manager or a statistician will come up with very different visualizations.\u00a0The problem, today, is that we are witnessing some kind of \u201c over-aesthetization \u201c. The more visible perspective of what data visualization is about is defined by the results returned by search engines. They obviously emphasize design (beauty tends to be linked and shared more often), not visualizations made by engineers or statisticians. And it all started with Edward Tufte. He must be proud (I always wanted to write this).\u00a0This is bad, because many people may start to equate data visualization and pretty charts, nice to look at but not terribly useful for their job and their skill sets. \n Occam\u2019s razor, or How can we avoid an aesthetic disaster? \n To tell you the truth, I\u2019m glad most corporate charts are not listed in the search engine results. Many are ugly, useless and childish (yes, childish). But if you can\u2019t even choose the right tie for your shirt how can you avoid a disaster when making a chart? \n Glad you ask. There are no easy answers, but let me put it this way: if your goal is to facilitate chart reading, remove everything that cannot be justified and justify all the other options. That\u2019s probably the safest way to avoid major disasters. \n It\u2019s easier to explain with an example. Compare the first chart, using the embarrassing defaults in Excel 2003 (the smiling cow adds the childish touch) with the second chart, also made using Excel 2003. \n  \n Let me justify my options: \n \n Why\u00a0is the title not centered? Because left aligned text is easier to read; \n Why\u00a0is the vertical axis line not displayed? Because most of the time is unnecessary, specially when you have axis labels and grid lines; \n Why\u00a0don\u2019t you use a legend? Because direct labeling minimizes eye movement and working memory usage; \n Why\u00a0are grid lines light gray? Because they are less relevant than the data itself; \n Why\u00a0are grid lines dashed? To differentiate them from the horizontal axis line; \n Why\u00a0is the line Chicken wider than the others? Because it is the series that interests me the most and I want to draw your attention to it; \n Why\u00a0there seems to be three colors with varying tones? For you to realize that the series in each group have something in common (red meat, poultry, fish) ; \n Why\u00a0was the happy cow removed? Because its childish, distracts and adds no benefit whatsoever. \n \n I suggest you to continue the exercise with some more questions and answers (why don\u2019t you label Lamb and Veal? Why is Year on the right?). At first, not all your answers will be coherent and consistent with your goal but you\u2019ll get there. \n Color is one of the major components of aesthetics and very hard to manage. The colors above were not chosen at random. The reddish tones are associated with red meat, orange with poultry and blue with fish. Is this the best possible color combination (assuming it exists)? Far from it. This is just a choice that I can justify, and that in general will be better than a different one base on personal taste alone. \n This chart will not win a beauty contest in the near future but, because your goal is to facilitate reading and you are forced to justify all your options, the risk of an arbitrary solution based on a not-to-be-trusted aesthetic sensibility is greatly minimized. Gradually your answers will become more consistent, the process more natural and you\u2019ll find your own style. \n \u00a0At this level, function and aesthetics are deeply intertwined. If you want to explore further, well, let\u2019s just say, like the ancient maps: \u201chere be dragons\u201d. Now aesthetics begins to have its own, autonomous value, with a greater emotional charge. Well used, it will attract the eye and enrich the experience without reducing the effectiveness or misrepresenting the message. Misused, it will become decoration and makeup, hindering communication and changing the message. \n There are multiple aesthetics \n Newton\u2019s Binomial is as beautiful as Venus de Milo. What happens is that few people notice it. \n Perhaps we could follow Fernando Pessoa and write: \n Minard\u2019s map of Napoleon\u2019s March\u00a0is as beautiful as the Sistine Chapel. \n  \n Beauty in a chart lies not in its ability to provide a moment of aesthetic enjoyment but in helping us understand the world, elegantly. So, start making elegant charts and aesthetics be damned! \n P.S.: If you\u2019re interested to find the right balance between aesthetics and function in the context of data visualization, you cannot avoid Alberto Cairo\u2019s The Functional Art , probably the best data visualization book published in 2012. \n \n______________________\n \nWant to create better dashboards?

When it comes to data visualization, Excel is generally dispised, except by those that have to make dozens of charts every single day. I call this the Excel Stockolm Syndrome .\u00a0These are the forsaken data visualization users that keep making 3D pies when they should know better by now. Tired and\u00a0overwhelmed. Not in the mood the\u00a0learn yet another tool just to make those elusive \u201ceffective charts\u201d. If you link good visualization to a tool they have no access to, you can be sure that the whole message is lost. \n Becoming a Data Visualization Anarchist \n I think things can be changed from the inside, improving the way people use Excel.\u00a0I write for Excel users because I\u2019m one of them. That\u2019s not going to change soon.\u00a0 But I love data visualization, not the tools that make it happen . I specially like interaction, multiple charts and making them available on the web. And I need to manage more data (not big data, just more data). Some things can\u2019t be done in Excel or require too much effort. \n The Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa has a funny short story called The Anarchist Banker . The idea is that only a banker can be a true anarchist, because only a banker can be free from \u201csocial fictions\u201d, specially money\u2026\u00a0In data visualization, this means getting the tools out of the way, by learning them or avoiding them. \n I chose the learning path and I\u2019m learning R now. I always wanted to make those scatterplot matrices. And I want to play with the ggplot2 package. A programming language is covered but R is not going to pay the bills. \n Enter Tableau and Qlikview \n I will not complicate matters \u00a0by discussing how I chose Tableau and Qlikview and not Spotfire, for example. I just want to choose one. Qlikview vs Tableau. Comparison articles like this \u00a0and this \u00a0are very helpful, but a man is a man with his circumstances. Each starting point is different from everyone else. Let me tell you what I think I know about these tools in this early stage. \n Tableau \n  \n I like Tableau, I have to admit it. I like the fact that you don\u2019t have to fight stupid defaults in design and formatting, because I share the same data visualization principles. \n I like its enthusiastic and\u00a0knowledgeable\u00a0community. Let me give you two simple examples. I spent a lot of time making this horizon chart \u00a0in Excel,\u00a0and Joe Mako quickly came up with a better version in Tableau. \n Then I tried to be creative with the bamboo charts and Joe Mako strikes again, with a better implementation . I\u2019m starting to get nervous\u2026 (kidding) \n I know and respect many Tableau users, not because of Tableau but because I share the same views regarding data visualization. \n Apparently, maps in Tableau are good enough, so that\u2019s a good point. \n And as a blogger, I want to make my work available to the web, and Tableau Public is a nice option (my population pyramid ). \n The Guardian often publishes Tableau visualizations. I\u2019d like to try that with the local newspapers here. \n On the other hand, we know how stubborn some datavis experts are. Is Tableau that stubborn? Can clear vision and the right principles become a straitjacket? I really hate\u00a0straitjackets (\u201cthe idea of\u201d, never actually tried one\u2026) \n In my country, Tableau is virtually unknown and I am not sure if I want to sell shoes in Africa . \n Qlikview \n  \nI know even less about Qlikview. The first chart I see in its video is the \u00a0pie chart above. Not exactly a shiny example of good data visualization principles. \n Apparently there is a very active Qlikview community on Linkedin \u00a0but not so much on Twitter. Probably this is meaningful. \n I keep reading that Qlikview is better than Tableau when it comes to making dashboards, while you should explore the data with Tableau. It\u2019s a good point in favor of Qlikview (that\u2019s what I need now). Extensions and the market seem to be interesting too. \n Qlikview has several business partners here. Actually, I was invited to work in some Qlikview projects in 2013 (obviously I have to learn the basics until then). They can pay a lot of bills. \n Its not always about features \n Not everything is black and white, not everything can be decided based on feature-by-feature comparison. Not everything is heart, not everything is reason. If I choose Tableau, my data visualization skills will improve a lot. Qlikview is harder to predict. I\u2019m sure there are many users that dislike the pie above. If not, Qlikview can be more, hummm, challenging. \n What I\u2019m going to do \n I mentioned those Qlikview projects, but I\u2019ll try to remove them from the equation, at least for now. \n I have a simple dashboard in Excel and I\u2019d like to create Tableau and Qlikview versions. That\u2019s probably one best ways to evaluate a tool, using my own work. \n So, can you help me? \n I\u2019d love to learn from you. Can you answer questions like: \n \n How do they compare regarding maps? Is it simple to add your own maps? \n Is it true that it\u2019s easier to make a a centrally designed dashboard in Qlikview, while Tableau has a more exploratory nature? \n How can I share a Qlikview chart in my blog? \n \n And please don\u2019t tell me I have to learn both\u2026 \n \n \n______________________\n \nWant to create better dashboards?

While playing with the data, you make these two charts: \n \n You already know that a bar chart helps you to compare data points, while a line chart is better at displaying trends, right? But you keep staring at them, not knowing which one to choose. \u00a0Suddenly, your little guardian angel\u00a0whispers: \u201cthe bar chart is wrong\u201d. \n The bar chart? What\u2019s wrong with the bar chart? And why is the line chart OK? \n Then you realize that the vertical scale starts at 30, and apparently it should start at zero, so you change it in both charts: \n \n That leaves a lot of white space under the line. The experts say you don\u2019t have to start scales at zero if you are using line charts. So you revert the changes in the line chart: \n  \n Ah, yes! Now you can choose one of them. Your guardian angel agrees that both charts are correct. So, do it, pick one! \n What\u2019s the problem? Is there something bothering you? \n Humm, I see. They don\u2019t look that similar. You believe that people may draw different conclusions depending on the chart you choose. \n OK, let\u2019s discuss this a bit. Let\u2019s talk about resolution . \n What is chart resolution, anyway? \n Higher resolution is usually a good thing. It means that you can see more clearly the difference between data points. To improve resolution in a chart, you zoom in, using the numeric scales: \n \n How much you can zoom in? Well, the lower limit should be the first nice round number below the minimum value in your data set, and the upper limit should be (you\u2019ve guess it) the first nice round number above the maximum value . \n You have to make a little change to the rule when it comes to bar charts. In a bar chart, people compare heights, so if the bars are not proportional to the data they encode, you are misleading your audience. So, the charts above are both correct, but the one below is not: \n  \n That\u2019s why the lower limit in a bar chart should always be the value that maintains the right proportions (usually zero). So, the take-away message is, improve resolution byt changing the scale, but in a bar chart you must keep proportions aligned with the data . \n What about slopes? \n Line charts are more\u00a0subtle. Both charts below are correct: \n  \n The only difference between them is that the one on the left has a higher resolution, and in general is a better option considering Cleveland\u2019s suggestions for banking to 45\u00ba \u00a0(slopes should average around 45\u00ba). You can do it by changing the numeric scales and/or the chart aspect ratio. This is a suggestion (an excellent suggestion), but it also tells you that there is no strict rule to obey. \n To be completely honest, I don\u2019t care much about scales or aspect ratio in line charts , as long as they do not go overboard. What really matters is to have something to compare with. In the post \u00a0Weltanschauung, Lies and Charts , I use these politically biased charts\u2026 \n \n \u2026 and argue that only when you have more than one series you can learn anything from a line chart, like this: \n \n So it doesn\u2019t matter much what you do with scales or \u00a0aspect ratio, as long as you have two or more series and your goal is to compare them. \n You can learn more about scales in Naomi Robbin\u2019s Creating More Effective Graphs and she often writes about it, like in\u00a0 here and here . \n Perhaps you could use this as a rule of thumb: use a bar chart when you have a single series and a line chart when you have two or more series. It will not always work, but it\u2019s a good starting point, don\u2019t you think? \n By the way: \u201cm\u00e9fiez-vous des morceaux choisis\u201d is a lovely French expression that roughly translates to\u00a0\u201dbeware of selected pieces\u201d. \n \n \n______________________\n \nWant to create better dashboards?

The tool you are using must let you pause and explore, like Rosling does with Trendalyzer and Gapminder Desktop . \n Instead of a movie, why don\u2019t you take a look at the individual video frames instead? \n  \n As you can see, the spatial pattern is still there, and you can easily compare individual maps. \n By the way, you\u2019ll probably miss spatial patterns if you use a regular chart. You should always check for this patterns when you have a dataset with a spatial dimension. But don\u2019t assume that the story ends there. Remove this dimension and you\u2019ll find other (and often more interesting/useful) patterns. Compare the small multiples above with the reorderable matrix below: \n  \n The spatial pattern is powerful (a \u201cwild-fire\u201d) and memorable, but if I had to choose, I would choose the reorderable matrix. Lots of interesting and more precise details there that you can\u2019t see in the map, and you still have a glimpse of the regional pattern via color coding. \n I actually like this sequence\u2026 It starts with a bang and then you can calmly explore the spatial patterns and the other details. \n What do you think? \n PS: You probably know the much better-looking map Nathan posted a while ago with this data set . That\u2019s where the original idea for this post comes from. \n PS2: Next week we\u2019ll see the result of combining counties (the gray dots in the maps) with store location.

The infographic plague we have to endure is not helping. \n It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Stephen Few wrote recently about the distinction between data visualization (\u201cthe goal that data be visualized in a way that leads to understanding\u201d) and data art (\u201cvisualizations of data that seek primarily to entertain or produce an aesthetic experience\u201d). Robert Kosara gives data art a different meaning . \n While I strongly agree with this, I am unable to see where to draw the line : there is no data visualization without graphic design and no data art without data. For the sake of the argument, let\u2019s think of data visualization as 10% of graphic design and 90% of data and data art as 90% of graphic design and 10% of data. It\u2019s a continuum, where the nature and the purpose change when the percentages change. \n It\u2019s fun to play with these meaningless percentages, so let\u2019s carry on. Suppose that a typical Excel user with no graphic design skills or training becomes aware of what data visualization is all about. She understands that some basic rules can improve effectiveness and make her charts aesthetically pleasing. She\u2019s still using traditional charts, but she\u2019s moving the split to the 75% data / 25%\u00a0 design mark. At the 80%/20% mark we can start talking about \u201cfunctional aesthetics\u201d. We haven\u2019t left data visualization yet. \n Around 60% data / 40% design, things start to change (I would place a typical New York Times visualization around here). Design can no longer improve data visualization and it slowly becomes data illustration (at 49% data / 51% design). The designer is making a unique piece and he uses a lot more textures and non-traditional charts, but he still believes (or wants us to believe) that the main goal is to inform and \u00a0 entertain. I would place David McCandless around the 30% data / 70% design mark. \n Finally, at the 25%/75% mark data illustration becomes data art and the graphic designer becomes an artist. He\u2019s now free of all constraints.\u00a0 The data can be the starting point, but he uses it to create a unique work of art. \n Again, don\u2019t take these percentages too seriously. I do believe that aesthetics play a major role in data visualization and it\u2019s always there, no matter what. But if, at some point, we find ourselves trying to make out charts more beautiful and memorable than more effective, we are changing their nature and their usefulness in a corporate environment. As Stephen Few puts it, it\u2019s \u201cfrivolous, costly, and harmful\u201d. \n Leave data art to art galleries and please, please, don\u2019t try to be an artist with Excel and canned effects. \n So, where are you in the data visualization \u2013 data art continuum? \n \n \n______________________\n \nWant to create better dashboards?
