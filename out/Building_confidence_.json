In the testimony, the GAO sent DNA from 5 anonymous donors to 4 anonymous DTC companies. At times, the results were astonishing, such as claims made by some of the companies taking advantage of ill-informed customers to sell custom supplements \u201cbased\u201d on genetic test results. However, the testimony also revealed a fundamental disconnect in communication between science, medicine, and the public: a disconnect that has always existed, but is now being brought to the public eye, as recent technologies have begun to bridge the gap between scientists and consumers. \n To preface, it is of course outrageous that anyone interpret a DTC genetic test as a diagnostic test (at least in their current form). Analysis of a personal genome is not a medical test. For the bulk of genetic markers, having a \u201chigh risk\u201d allele for a disease is not even close to a diagnosis of the disease. It is simply an indicator that on average, in the particular population chosen by a research study (which are often small populations or populations selected to be enriched for a particular disease), individuals with that particular allele had a higher incidence of the disease in question than individuals without the allele (i.e. the \u201chigh risk\u201d allele has a higher odds for the disease than the other). The companies then translate into a overall disease risk, which adjusts the prior probability of getting the disease by this odds ratio. Depending on which studies and genes/alleles a company takes into consideration, this risk may be vary considerably. In any case, the report provides a final probability of getting a disease, which may or may not actually be the same as the actual outcome. Just as an individual can get lung cancer without smoking, one can get diabetes even with a below average risk. \n This is not to say all the calculations of the disease risk interpretations of all these companies are flawless (we haven\u2019t verified the math and studies in all these companies), but the fact remains that there are legitimate scientific differences on how to interpret the data. While no particular method is outright \u201cwrong,\u201d there are better and worse ways to analyze results of genetic tests and competition among DTC companies for the highest quality interpretations should become increasingly important. Of course, it is objectively difficult to measure which interpretation is \u201cbest,\u201d but this will change as more data become available both in predictive claims and possibilities for validation. \n According to the testimony, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Secretary\u2019s Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society notes that \u201c[practitioners] cannot keep up with the pace of genetic tests and are not adequately prepared to use test information to treat patients appropriately.\u201d While this may be true at present, this need not stop information from genetic tests from entering the clinic. A general practitioner may not be able to keep up with the latest advances in neurosurgery, but that\u2019s where the specialist system thrives. In any case, just as clinicians are expected to demonstrate a basic level of competence in immunology in medical school, genetics must be treated the same way. Here at Stanford, a pilot project was launched to teach medical students about the field of genetic testing in an interactive classroom setting with state-of-the-art methods for analysis of personal genotypes. \n Deceptive marketing, including \u201cpersonalized supplements\u201d (allegedly with celebrity endorsements) and drugs that may \u201crepair damaged DNA\u201d (allegedly called \u201cepigenetics\u201d), to say nothing of surreptitious testing and scientifically nonsensical claims, are inexcusable and irresponsible practices for any company, not limited to this particular market. However, the delicate matter of genetic testing and its use as a clinical guidance tool is a concept that must be explored further. The GAO uses the phrase \u201cmisleading test results\u201d: it should be noted that while the current implementation of the reporting of test results may be in certain ways misleading, the framework of genetic testing is not in itself misleading. Proper interpretation is based in the same mathematical and biological context as much of today\u2019s medicine. There is great potential for the use of genetic tests in the clinic, so long as results are carefully interpreted. While this was often limited to geneticists in the past, we hope that this can be soon accomplished by physicians and the public."], "link":

have decided to offer a class on personal genomics to the medical students. \u00a0The class is elective, and getting your 1 million SNPs tested is optional. \u00a0If you want your own SNPs, you have to pay $99 (it\u2019s sounds like a copay, why not also give them the experience of our whacky medical finance system while we are at it? \u00a0They are going to learn a ton in this course!). \u00a0If you don\u2019t do your own genotypes, they have a standard reference genome for you to do the homeworks. \u00a0The class is lead by my colleague Stuart Kim and an enterprising MD/PhD student, Keyan Salari , who really fueled the effort to offer the course. \u00a0This course was not easy to get going. \u00a0There was significant and legitimate concerns among the faculty about the prudence of doing this. \u00a0There was an entertaining and informative email debate during which we fleshed out the issues. \u00a0We also watched the response to the proposal to genotype incoming Berkeley undergraduates (I\u2019m also a fan of that). \u00a0 The Stanford Dean\u2019s office has released an announcement discussing the course and the decision process and safeguards that have been put in place. \u00a0Outstanding. \n I am honored to be participating in the class as a lecturer on\u2013you guessed it\u2013 Pharmacogenomics . \u00a0The students have all heard my standard talk as part of their basic genetics curriculum, so we will do some advanced stuff in this class. \u00a0I think that we will have them assess the genetics of response to some drugs based on very solid pharmacogenomics evidence: \u00a0 statins , clopidogrel and warfarin . \u00a0I will have them all compute the ideal dose of warfarin from the genome they are working with based on the dosing equation we published last year (or maybe the modified one we published this year ) that uses genetics. \u00a0 Then, for fun and to get them really thinking, we will assess the genetics of response to other drugs where the evidence is published but not as firm. \u00a0This is going to be the more common situation for using genetics in pharmacology, and they need to start understanding how to take imperfect evidence and fold it into their medical decision making about prescribing. \u00a0I haven\u2019t decided which drugs to cover there, but our recent paper analyzing Steve Quake\u2019s genome offered some interesting inferences on more than 100 drugs, so I will pick some that may be relevant to young physicians. \n Anyway, this is great, and I am proud that we are trying to push the agenda of bringing personal genomics to medical training. \u00a0 Someday, I hope this is a mandatory part of pharmacology or genetics or both, but I\u2019ll take an elective at this point."], "link":
