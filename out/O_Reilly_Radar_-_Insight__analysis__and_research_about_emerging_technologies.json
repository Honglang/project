Twitter is so immediate, so of the moment, but it connects people across the globe who may be experiencing very different moments. \n This first struck me during the Arab Spring. Maybe I was just finishing a nice dinner in Philadelphia and was lingering over a drink, tweeting the usual crap, while a world away Egyptians (and later Libyans and Syrians) were out by the thousands throwing themselves into mortal danger. Of course, they weren\u2019t paying attention to my banalities while they filled Tahir Square and defended Aleppo, but I still floated by. And in any case, my tweet stream was full of their moment, raging past me. Once I noticed the dichotomy, my political witticisms and flippant comments on the news of the day tossed out between bites of my dessert seemed ridiculous as they bobbed downstream amidst all that anger, action, and danger. It just felt so, \u2026 inappropriate. I couldn\u2019t help but go silent. A more primitive sense of decorum, evolved while our voices shared common place and time, welled up and shut me up. \n I thought of this again the other night but in reverse. I was very fortunate and came through Sandy basically unscathed. But in the late afternoon of the storm I was out in the wind and rain for about an hour and a half trying to stop a water leak that was flowing through my foundation into the basement, while the whole time I had one eye on a 100-foot pine tree that was swaying threateningly over me. When I came back in, soaked through, and with my mind 100% on Sandy and my immediate safety, I checked Twitter out of habit. Naturally, the first tweet I saw was from Darrell Issa, snug in California, tweeting about the latest non-hurricane-related thing he wanted us to rage about. Dammit Darrell, we\u2019re in the middle of a hurricane, we\u2019ll get pissed about Benghazi next week ok? \n During Sandy most of us east coasters had just one thing on our minds while our west coast friends\u2019 normal lives continued unabated. We were tweeting about threatening trees, power outages, and 14th street fire balls while they were tweeting about Windows 8, a Yammer user conference, and whatnot. Lots of people on both coasts, who didn\u2019t feel immediately threatened, were making light and telling jokes. In response I saw more than a few tweets along the lines of \u201cnot really appreciating the jokes while I watch the water rise.\u201d \n When I went about my business during the Arab Spring I used to feel weird, like they might read my tweets and think \u201cDon\u2019t you know we\u2019re dying out here? There you are just living your life. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d The other night I had to remind myself that 2,500 miles and the continental divide separated my moment from those of my friends in California. Two streams, naturally bifurcated by geography and current experience, flowed together to mix awkwardly on my phone. \n And it continues now. For many of us even here in the East, Sandy is basically over. We are fortunate. We have power, food in the refrigerator, and a place to brew our coffee. But all over New Jersey and New York this remains far from true . The storm will be millions of people\u2019s primary context for weeks to come. I can\u2019t help but wonder what it must be like to risk a bit of carefully hoarded smart phone battery, while separated from the flood-ravaged street by flight after flight of dark staircase, to take a quick glance at Twitter only to see \u201cOMFG, will Disney put mouse ears on Darth Vader?\u201d That\u2019s #dissonance. \n In the immediacy of the moment, this isn\u2019t context collapse, where we self-consciously present ourselves to the context multi-verse in some subconsciously bland and universally appropriate way. Nope, this is a massive context collision because Twitter is so here and now. Here we are just jotting down our immediate thoughts, cozy in our moment, and firing them off to ricochet around everyone else\u2019s. \n And what else should we expect? I saw a tweet the other day admonishing all of us for not having paid attention to Sandy when she was still ravaging the Caribbean on her way here. I wasn\u2019t there. It wasn\u2019t my experience. I\u2019m not sure what to do with that. \n I think one of the things that made things particularly jarring during Sandy is that usually my tweet stream is the exposed consciousness of a single tribe. Left coast or right, the technologists I follow are approximately alike on both coasts. Conversations coalesce around similar memes and you\u2019d have a hard time pulling an individual\u2019s geography out of their topic and focus. But not today, and certainly not in the last two days. Our lives will be filled with very different experiences for a while. I\u2019m at a funeral, you\u2019re at a party, and we\u2019re talking on the phone. \n In any case, don\u2019t read this as a scold. It\u2019s not. I\u2019m just reflecting on my own disquiet. My sense of social norms developed in a face-to-face world and I can\u2019t help but feel an unease, an idea that I\u2019m behaving inappropriately, when my tweets are out of synch with the mass of experience that is flowing past me."], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/Kj9RDxBy2UY/sorry-i-was-laughing-during-your-funeral.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://gothamist.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "O'Reilly Radar - Insight, analysis, and research about emerging technologies"}, {"content": ["Turing Complete User \u2014 General Purpose Users can write an article in their e-mail client, layout their business card in Excel and shave in front of a web cam.

It showed up on iPhones: \n This Emergency Alert just popped up on my phone. Ten seconds later, the TV went out. Here we go. #sandy #ny1sandy twitter.com/mbchp/status/2\u2026 \n \u2014 Mike Beauchamp (@mbchp) October 30, 2012 \n \u2026and upon Android devices: \n Emergency alert on my phone. instagr.am/p/RYvlmJxJec/ \n \u2014 Heidi N. Moore (@moorehn) October 30, 2012 \n While the message was clear enough, the way that these messages ended up on the screens may not have been clear to recipients or observers . And still other New Yorkers were left wondering why emergency alerts weren\u2019t on their phones. \n Here\u2019s the explanation: the emergency alerts that went out last night came from New York\u2019s Personal Localized Alerting Network, the \u201c PLAN \u201d the Big Apple launched in late 2011. \n NYC chief digital officer Rachel Haot confirmed that the messages New Yorkers received last night were the result of a public-private partnership between the Federal Communications Commission , the Federal Emergency Management Agency , the New York City Office of Emergency Management (OEM), the CTIA and wireless carriers. \n While the alerts may look quite similar to text messages, the messages themselves run in parallel, enabling them to get through txt traffic congestion. NYC\u2019s PLAN is the local version of the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) that has been rolling out nation-wide over the last year. \n \u201cThis new technology could make a tremendous difference during disasters like the recent tornadoes in Alabama where minutes \u2013 or even seconds \u2013 of extra warning could make the difference between life and death,\u201d said FCC chairman Julius Genachowski, speaking last May in New York City. \u201cAnd we saw the difference alerting systems can make in Japan, where they have an earthquake early warning system that issued alerts that saved lives.\u201d \n NYC was the first city to have it up and running, last December, and less than a year later, the alerts showed up where and when they mattered. \n \n The first such message I saw shared by a New Yorker actually came on October 28th, when the chief digital officer of the Columbia Journalism School, Sree Sreenivasan, tweeted about receiving the alert: \n [photo] Nice to get alert from NYC.gov about evacuation (also nice it\u2019s not about our area). #sandy twitter.com/sree/status/26\u2026 \n \u2014 Sree Sreenivasan (@sree) October 28, 2012 \n He tweeted out the second alert he received, on the night of the 29th, as well: \n [photo] COOL TECH: Loud alarm and screen alert about #sandy making landfall in NYC. (cc @ digiphile ) twitter.com/sree/status/26\u2026 \n \u2014 Sree Sreenivasan (@sree) October 30, 2012 \n These PLAN alerts go out to everyone in a targeted geographic area with enabled mobile devices, enabling emergency management officials at the state and local level to get an alert to the right people at the right time. And in an emergency like a hurricane, earthquake or fire, connecting affected residents to critical information at the right time and place are essential. \n While the government texting him gave national security writer Marc Ambinder some qualms about privacy, the way the data is handled looks much less disconcerting than, say, needing to opt-out of sharing location data or wireless wiretapping . \n PLAN alerts are free and automatic, unlike opt-in messages from Notify NYC or signing up for email alerts from OEM . \n Not all New Yorkers received an emergency alert during Sandy because not all mobile devices have the necessary hardware installed or have updated relevant software. In May 2011, new iPhones and Android devices already had the chip. (Most older phones, not so much.) \n These alerts don\u2019t go out for minor issues, either: the system is only used by authorized state, local or national officials during public safety emergencies. They send the alert to CMAS, it\u2019s authenticated, and then the system pushes it out to all enabled devices in a geographic area. \n Emergency alert message on my phone: \u201cTake shelter now!\u201d #eastvillage #sandy instagr.am/p/RYza7_gzGZ/ \n \u2014 Ola Forsstrom-Olsson (@olaforsstrom) October 30, 2012 \n Consumers receive only three types of messages: alerts issued by the President, Amber Alerts , and alerts involving \u201cimminent threats to safety or life.\u201d The last category covers the ones that went out about Hurricane Sandy in NYC last night. \n According to the FCC, participating mobile carriers can allow their subscribers to block all but Presidential alerts, although it may be a little complicated to navigate a website or call center to do so. By 2014, every mobile phone sold in the United States must be CMAS-capable. (You can learn more about CMAS in this PDF ).

Excessive wear in that environment can lead to a failure that ruins an expensive part, but it\u2019s difficult to use physical means to detect wear on cutting surfaces: human operators can\u2019t see it and detailed microscopic inspections are costly. The result is that many operators simply replace parts on a pre-determined schedule \u2014 every two months, perhaps \u2014 that ends up being overly conservative. \n  The researchers\u2019 milling machine, shown with sensors near the cutting device.

Techniques from areas like machine learning, which can be computationally intensive, can thus be available in monitoring parts as small and common as cutting surfaces in milling machines. \n \n \u201cThis is a simple optimization problem,\u201d says Meng Joo Er , a professor at the Nanyang Technological University and an author of the paper. \u201cBut you\u2019re talking about a very expensive piece of equipment working on a very expensive product. We have to be very careful.\u201d \n  The cutting tool, enlarged under a microscope, after four cuts (Source: ibid.) \n Er and his colleagues outfitted a high-speed computer-controlled milling machine with a handful of common sensors: accelerometers to measure vibrations, an acoustic emission sensor to measure stress waves and a dynamometer to measure cutting forces. The researchers then used data from these sensors along with measurements of wear taken through a microscope as a training set for two machine-learning algorithms (one ANFIS model and one SVM model). The researchers managed to predict wear at above 90% by the ANFIS method and 85% by the SVM method. \n  The same surface showing wear (Source: ibid.) \n That\u2019s accurate enough to find its way into application although, Er notes, industrial users will likely combine this sort of method with conventional fallbacks, and it will take longer to make its way into very-high-stakes fields like aviation. Computation time for running the trained model \u2014 now on the order of 25 seconds for the more accurate model and half a second for the less accurate \u2014 will also need to come down, and engineers will need to find ways to integrate these types of models into the industrial control systems that are ubiquitous in automated manufacturing. \n Nevertheless, this is a good lens for peering into the future of connected machines: generate lots of data, let software swallow it up, and optimize away. \n *Available for a fee from IEEE : X.

First, the company literally will move to a new office space in the Central Market area of San Francisco by mid-2013, according to a report by Leena Rao at TechCrunch. Rao notes that the company has grown to more than 400 employees and reports Square plans to expand its staff to almost 1,000 people before the end of 2013. \n Square also announced this week that its service is now available in Canada, at the same 2.75% rate it charges in the U.S., according to a report by Ingrid Lunden at TechCrunch. Lunden reports one of the obstacles for Square in Canadian as well as European markets is that its dongle depends on the magnetic stripe on the backs of credit cards; many credit card processes in these markets use a chip-and-pin system instead. \n The obstacle isn\u2019t insurmountable, however, as Lunden notes, Square\u2019s partnership with Starbucks to incorporate its Pay With Square app service as a mode of payment might pave the way forward with retailers in other markets, making the card processing format irrelevant. \n Square competitor PayPal Here was on the move this week as well \u2014 into retail shopping. Rao reports in a separate post at TechCrunch that PayPal CEO John Donahoe announced a U.S. retail deal with AT&T during eBay\u2019s earning call this week. PayPal Here previously had a retail presence only in Japan with Softbank. Rao reports that Here will retail for $15, with the purchaser receiving a $15 discount upon signing up; Square is sold in 20,000 outlets in the U.S. and sells for $10, with a $10 purchaser sign-up discount, Rao reports. \n \n Let the mobile payment testing begin \n The long-awaited Isis mobile wallet began testing this week in Austin and Salt Lake City markets. Stephanie Mlot reports at PC Magazine that compatible phones at launch include Samsung Galaxy S III, Galaxy S Relay 4G, and Galaxy S II on T-Mobile; the HTC Droid Incredible 4G LTE on Verizon, with Motorola Droid Razr HD and Droid Razr Maxx HD support coming yet this week; and the Samsung Galaxy S III, the HTC One X, the Samsung Exhilarate, the LG Escape, and the Samsung Galaxy Rugby Pro on AT&T. \n Mlot also reports that T-Mobile customers can get $10 in Isis eCash if they visit a brick-and-mortar location and activate the application. At launch, Isis works with Chase, Capitol One, Barclaycard, American Express, Visa, Mastercard and Discover credit cards. \n As to Isis\u2019 success, a report at Consumer Reports says services like Isis are solving \u201ca non-existent problem\u201d and concludes: \u201cIsis, like Google Wallet, still seems to require a lot of work and needless complexity for the questionable convenience of paying by cell phone.\u201d \n Apple also announced this week that it too soon would be testing a mobile payment solution in a limited market \u2014 its own retail stores. Mark Gurman reports at 9to5Mac that Apple is preparing to update its point of sale system to scan Apple Store payment card codes through Passbook. The payment system update could be ready as early as the end of this month. Jordan Golson writes at MacRumors that though it\u2019s not confirmed, it\u2019s possible in-store customers also will be able to pay for any merchandise using their iTunes account information; thus far, only select accessories have been available for purchase through Apple\u2019s EasyPay self-checkout system. \n Google Wallet on the iPhone? \n Business Insider\u2019s Owen Thomas was paying close attention this week, noting the \u201cThe next version of Google Wallet, coming soon\u201d statement at the top of Google\u2019s Wallet homepage , with an option for visitors to request an invite. Thomas reports that when he requested the invite, he was prompted to select the type of device he uses: iPhone, Android, or \u201cother.\u201d \n Ryan Kim at GigaOm agrees with Thomas\u2019 assertion that this likely suggests Google is looking to expand its purview beyond Android phones and into iPhones and \u201cothers,\u201d but notes it really could mean anything.

I\u2019ve always enjoyed hearing his take on the state of CSS, as he manages to find combinations of capabilities that make CSS more powerful than I thought it was when I first looked. \n We sat down last week to discuss the many huge changes CSS3 is bringing, from improvements to old capabilities to completely new tools for animations, transforms, and layout. The continuous rate of change and the size of the specification are driving him to serialize the next edition of the Definitive Guide , releasing it in pieces. Developers can work from familiar foundations, but reach new destinations. The declarative strength of CSS3 lets you create presentation by describing it, and that style keeps proving more powerful. \n Highlights of the interview include: \n \n CSS3 brings big changes in font capabilities, letting you send fonts to users [discussed at the 2:30 mark ] and sites putting those improvements to work [ 15:50 ]. \n The many options can make choosing a set of parts seem difficult [discussed at the 4:21 mark ], but JavaScript shims that add support for CSS properties can make it easier to use properties even if browsers haven\u2019t come around to them [ 6:08 ] \n Which of your features are like rounded corners?

The system is still under development and, as Kaspersky himself notes, will only take final form after it goes through lots of application-specific development.

I\u2019d be facing a live international audience at a moment of intense political interest, without a great wealth of on-air training. That said, I felt honored to be asked by Al Jazeera. I\u2019ve been following the network\u2019s steady evolution over the past two decades, building from early beginnings during the first Gulf War to its current position as one of the best sources of live coverage and hard news from the Middle East. When Tahrir Square was at the height of its foment during the Arab Spring, Al Jazeera was livestreaming it online to the rest of the world. \n I\u2019ve been showing a slide in a presentation for months now that features Al Jazeera\u2019s \u201cThe Stream\u201d as a notable combination of social media, online video and broadcast journalism since its inception. \n So, by and large, the choice was clear: say \u201cyes,\u201d and then figure out how to do a good job. \n \n As is ever the case with new assignments, what would follow from that choice wasn\u2019t as easy as it might have seemed. Some of the nuts and bolts of appearing were quite straightforward: Do a long pre-interview with the producer about my work and my perspective on how the Internet and social media were changing the dynamics of a live political event like the debate. (I captured much of that thinking here at Radar, in a post on digital feedback loops and the debate .) Go through makeup each time. Get wired up with a mic and an earpiece that connected me to the control room. Review each show\u2019s outline, script and online engagement channels, from Twitter to YouTube to Google+ to Reddit . \n I was also afforded a few luxuries that bordered on the surreal: a driver that picked me up and took me home from the studio. Bottled spring water. A modest honorarium to hang out in a television studio for a couple of hours and talk for a few intense minutes about what moments from the debates resonated online and why. The realization that my perspective could be seen by millions in Al Jazeera English\u2019s international audience . People would be watching. I\u2019d need to deliver something worth their time. \n Entering The Stream \n Live television doesn\u2019t give anyone much room for error. On this particular show, The Stream, there was no room for a deep dive into analysis. We had time to answer a couple of questions of what happened on social media during the debates. Some spots were 30 seconds. Adding context in that context is a huge challenge. How much do you assume the people viewing know? What moments do you highlight? For this debate show, I had to assume that they watched the two candidates spar \u2014 but were they following the firehouse of commentary on Twitter? Even if they did, given how personalized social media has become, it was inevitable that what viewers saw online would be different than what we did in the studio. \n When we saw the campaigns focus on Twitter during the debates, I saw that as news, and said as much. While the campaigns were also on Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, YouTube and blogs, along with the people formerly known as the audience, the forum for real-time social politics in the fall of 2012 remained Twitter, in all its character-limited glory. \n Once the debates ended each night, campaigns and voters turned to the new watercoolers of the moment \u2014 blogs and article comment sections \u2014 to discuss what they\u2019d seen. They went to Facebook and Google+ to share their reactions. To their credit, the Stream producers used Google+ Hangouts to immediately ask undecided voters what they thought and bring in political journalists to share their impressions. It\u2019s a great use of the platform to involve more people in a show using the tools of the moment. \n I\u2019ve embedded each of the debate videos below, along with the full length episode of The Stream on data mining in the 2012 election. (I think I delivered, based upon the feedback I\u2019ve received since in person and online, but I\u2019m quite open to feedback if you\u2019d like to comment.) \n The Stream: Presidential Debates [10/3/2012] \n \n \n The Stream: Vice Presidential Debate [10/11/2012] \n \n The Stream: Presidential debates pre-show [10/16/2012] \n \n \n On memes, social journalism and listening \n The first two presidential debates and the vice-presidential debate spawned online memes. Given the issues before the country and the world, reducing these debates to those rapid expressions and the other moments that catalyzed strong online reactions was inherently self-limiting. The role of The Stream during the debates, however, was to look at these political events through the prism of social media to explain quickly and precisely what popped online. At this point, if you\u2019re following the election, you\u2019ve probably heard of at least two of them: Big Bird and \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d (I explain both in the videos embedded above.) We also saw acmes of attention and debate conflict reflected online, from Vice President Biden\u2019s use of \u201cmalarkey\u201d to reaction to CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley\u2019s real-time correction of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s challenge to President Obama regarding his use of \u201cact of terror\u201d on the day after the United States Embassy to Libya was attacked. \n There are limits to what you can discern through highlighting memes. While it might be easy to dismiss memes as silly or out-of-context moments, I think they serve a symbolic, even totemic role for people who share them online. There\u2019s also a simple historic parallel: animated GIFs are the political cartoons of the present. \n Reducing the role of social media in networked political debates to just Twitter, GIFs and status updates, however, would be a mistake. The combination of embeddable online video, blogs and wikis are all part of a blueprint for democratic participation that enables people to explore the issues debated in depth, which is particularly relevant if cable news shows fail to do so. \n There\u2019s also a risk of distracting from what we can learn about how the candidates would make policy or leadership decisions. I participated in a Google+ Hangout hosted by Storify last week about social media and elections. The panel of \u201csocial journalists\u201d shared their perspectives on how the #debates are being covered in this hyper-connected moment \u2014 and whether social media is playing a positive role or not. \n \n Personally, I see the role of social media in the current election as a mixed bag. Networked fact checking is a positive development. The campaigns and media alike can find interesting trends in real-time sentiment analysis, if they dive into the social data. I also see an important role for the broader Internet in providing as much analysis on policy or context as people are willing to search for, on social media or off. \n There\u2019s a risk, however, that public opinion or impressions of the debates are being prematurely shaped by the campaigns and their proxies, or that confirmation bias is being reaffirmed through homophilic relationships that are not representative of the electorate as whole. \n All that being said, after these three shows, I plan to watch the last presidential debate, on foreign policy, differently. I\u2019m going to pocket my smartphone, sleeve my iPad and keep my laptop closed. Instead of tracking the real-time feedback during the debates and participating in the ebb and flow of the conversation, I\u2019m just going to actively listen and take notes. There are many foreign policy questions that will confront the 45th President of the United States. Tonight, I want to hear the responses of the candidates, unadorned by real-time spin, fact checking, debate bingo or instant reaction. \n Afterwards, I\u2019ll go back online to read liveblogs , see where the candidates may have gone awry, and look abroad to see how the world is reacting to a debate on foreign policy that stands to directly affect billions of people who will never vote in a U.S. election. First, however, I\u2019ll form my own impressions, supported by the virtues of solitude , not the clamor of social media."], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/5sd00htIbwQ/debates-social-media-pundit-al-jazeera-english.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://thecaucus.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://www.wnyc.org/": 1, "http://sunlightlive.com": 1, "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/": 1, "http://radar.oreilly.com/": 1, "http://www.opencongress.org/": 1, "http://www.co.uk/": 1, "http://practiceofzen.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "O'Reilly Radar - Insight, analysis, and research about emerging technologies"}, {"content": ["jq \u2014 command-line tool for JSON data. \n GAFFTA \u2014 Gray Area Foundation For The Arts.
