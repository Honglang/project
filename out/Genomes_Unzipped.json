I\u2019m not going to spend time here recounting the project\u2019s scientific merit \u2013 suffice it to say that the project\u2019s analyses have already improved the way researchers are approaching the analysis of potential disease-causing genetic variants in non-coding regions, and will have an even greater impact over time.

The main idea was simple: replace the current system of pre-publication peer review with one in which all research is immediately published and only afterwards sorted according to quality and community interest. This post generated a lot of discussion; in conversations since, however, I\u2019ve learned that almost anyone who has thought seriously about the role of the internet in scientific communication has had similar ideas. The question, then, is not whether dramatic improvements in the system of scientfic publication are possible, but rather how to implement them. There is now a growing trickle of papers posted to pre-print servers ahead of formal publication. I am hopeful that this is bringing us close to dispensing with one of the major obstacles in the path towards a modern system of scientific communication: the lack of rapid and wide distribution of results. * Read the rest of this entry | Read comments"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GenomesUnzipped/~3/yY8Ru5m6rgQ/the-first-steps-towards-a-modern-system-of-scientific-publication.php", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.genomesunzipped.org/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Genomes Unzipped"}, {"content": ["Jimmy Cheng-Ho Lin, MD, PhD, MHS is the Founder/President of Rare\u00a0Genomics Institute , helping patients with rare diseases design,\u00a0source, and fund personalized genomics projects.

While nonprofits and foundations exist for many diseases, the vast majority of the 7,000 rare diseases do not have the scientific and philanthropic infrastructure to help. Many parents fight heroically on behalf of their children, and some of them have even become the driving force for research. At RGI, we are inspired by such parents and feel that if we can help provide the right tools and partnerships, extraordinary things can be achieved. We start by helping parents connect with the right researchers and clinicians . Then, we provide mechanisms for them to fundraise. Finally, we try to guide them through the science that hopefully result in a better life for their child or for future children.

The actual line-up of events has been diverse, and a lot of fun. We\u2019ve had two excellent debates, including one between Ewan Birney and Paul Flicek (pictured) on the value, or lack thereof, of celebrity genomes (covered in more detail here ).

Teresa is a PhD student at Cesagen, Cardiff University, studying with Adam Hedgecoe and Michael Arribas-Ayllon. A background in cancer nursing and a degree in human biology informed Teresa\u2019s interest in the public\u2019s use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing to \u2018self-screen\u2019 for disease risk. She recently secured funding from the ESRC to research users\u2019 and genetics clinicians\u2019 experiences of DTCGT in the UK. If you are a UK resident who has used a DTC genetic test, or a clinician whose patients have used these tests, then you too can get involved in the research . Direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTCGT) has been freely available on the Internet for more than five years, despite concerns from the professional community. Companies marketing these tests (such as 23andMe and deCODEme) claim they are empowering people to make healthy lifestyle choices, and frequently draw on the principle of autonomy as a central argument. This position is confirmed elsewhere by those who view genomic knowledge as an individual right, including many of the bloggers at Genomes Unzipped . Other scientists and clinicians express skepticism about the clinical validity and utility of DTCGT, and raise concerns about the potential for anxiety and inappropriate testing. These debates highlight the importance of research into the motivations and actions of DTCGC customers, but research to date remains very limited, and has mostly been performed on customers in North America. The UK, with its large state-run National Health Service and relative lack of private health insurance and providers, is likely to face unique challenges and situations as DTCGT becomes more common. The paucity of research on UK customers indicates the need for a detailed UK study examining users\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 perspectives in order to establish the long-term implications of DTCGT. This post outlines what is currently known about DTCGT, fills some gaps in the UK context and outlines a research project involving users and clinicians in the UK.

An article in Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News argues that as the cost of genome sequencing decreases, the cost of analysing the resulting data will balloon to extraordinary levels. Here is the crux of the argument: We predict that in the future a large sum of money will be invested in recruiting highly trained and skilled personnel for data handling and downstream analysis. Various physicians, bioinformaticians, biologists, statisticians, geneticists, and scientific researchers will be required for genomic interpretation due to the ever increasing data. Hence, for cost estimation, it is assumed that at least one bioinformatician (at $75,000), physician (at $110,000), biologist ($72,000), statistician ($70,000), geneticist ($90,000), and a technician ($30,000) will be required for interpretation of one genome. The number of technicians required in the future will decrease as processes are predicted to be automated. Also the bioinformatics software costs will plummet due to the decrease in computing costs as per Moore\u2019s law. Thus, the cost in 2011 for data handling and downstream processing is $285,000 per genome as compared to $517,000 per genome in 2017. These costs are calculated by tallying salaries of each person involved as well as the software costs. These numbers would be seriously bad news for the future of genomic medicine, if they were even remotely connected with reality. Fortunately this is not the case. In fact this article (and other alarmist pieces on the \u201c$1000 genome, $1M interpretation\u201d theme) wildly overstate the economic challenges of genomic interpretation.

The main study is very well carried out, and the two associations look to me to be well established.

Firstly, the main result that has been reported in the news is that the study found an \u201cIQ gene\u201d, but this was only a very small follow-on in the study, and the evidence underlying it is relatively weak (certainly not the \u201cBest evidence yet that a single gene can affect IQ\u201d, as reported by New Scientist ). Secondly, the authors use a misleading reporting of statistics to hide the fact that one of their association could easily be cause by an (already well known) association to general body size.

Our goal was to develop a method to identify RNA editing sites using matched DNA and RNA sequencing of the same sample. Looking at the problem initially, it seems straightforward enough to generate a list of variants using the RNA sequencing data and then filter out any variants that also appear in the DNA sequencing. In reality, one must pay close attention to the technical details in order to discern true RNA editing sites from false positives. In this post, we will highlight a couple of key strategies we employed to accurately identify editing sites.
