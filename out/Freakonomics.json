Subsidies instead should be targeted to fields where education has the greatest positive spillovers, benefits that spill over wages and flow to the public at large. Overall, this likely means subsidizing the STEM fields more than anthropology which is why the taskforce has the right idea. If the task force wants to explain the idea, however, they should make it clear that the goal is to focus subsidies on those fields where education most benefits the taxpayer. \n \n Readers, what do you think?"], "link": "http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/31/is-tuition-by-major-a-good-idea/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/": 1, "http://marginalrevolution.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Freakonomics"}, {"content": ["(Photo: Kim) \n With the U.S. presidential election nearly here, everyone seems to have politics on their mind.\u00a0 Unlike most people, economists tend to have an indifference towards voting .\u00a0 The way economists see it, the chances of an individual\u2019s vote influencing an election outcome is vanishingly small, so unless it is fun to vote, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to do so.\u00a0 On top of that, there are a number of theoretical results, most famously Arrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem , which highlight how difficult it is to design political systems/voting mechanisms that reliably aggregate the preferences of the electorate. \n Mostly, these theoretical explorations into the virtues and vices of democracy leave me yawning. \n Last spring, however, my colleague Glen Weyl mentioned an idea along these lines that was so simple and elegant that I was amazed no one had ever thought of it before.\u00a0 In Glen\u2019s voting mechanism , every voter can vote as many times as he or she likes.\u00a0 The catch, however, is that you have to pay each time you vote, and the amount you have to pay is a function of the square of the number of votes you cast.\u00a0 As a consequence, each extra vote you cast costs more than the previous vote.\u00a0 Just for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say the first vote costs you $1.\u00a0 Then to vote a second time would cost $4.\u00a0 The third vote would be $9 , the fourth $16, and so on. One hundred votes would cost you $10,000.\u00a0 So eventually, no matter how much you like a candidate, you choose to vote a finite number of times. \n What is so special about this voting scheme?\u00a0 People end up voting in proportion to how much they care about the election outcome.\u00a0 The system captures not just which candidate you prefer, but how strong your preferences are.\u00a0 Given Glen\u2019s assumptions, this turns out to be Pareto efficient \u2014 i.e., no person in society can be made better off without making someone else worse off. \n The first criticism you\u2019ll likely make against this sort of scheme is that it favors the rich.\u00a0 At one level that is true relative to our current system.\u00a0 It might not be a popular argument, but one thing an economist might say is that the rich consume more of everything \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t they consume more political influence? In our existing system of campaign contributions, there can be little doubt that the rich already have far more influence than the poor.\u00a0 So restricting campaign spending, in conjunction with this voting scheme, might be more democratic than our current system. \n Another possible criticism of Glen\u2019s idea is that it leads to very strong incentives for cheating through vote buying.\u00a0 It is much cheaper to buy the first votes of a lot of uninterested citizens than it is to pay the price for my 100 th vote.\u00a0 Once we put dollar values on votes, it is more likely that people will view votes through the lens of a financial transaction and be willing to buy and sell them. \n Given we\u2019ve been doing \u201cone person, one vote\u201d for so long, I think it is highly unlikely that we will ever see Glen\u2019s idea put into practice in major political elections.\u00a0 Two other economists, Jacob Goeree and Jingjing Zhang have been exploring a similar idea to Glen\u2019s and testing it in a laboratory environment . Not only does it work well, but when given a choice between standard voting and this bid system, the participants usually choose the bid system.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n This voting scheme can work in any situation where there are multiple people trying to choose between two alternatives \u2014 e.g., a group of people trying to decide which movie or restaurant to go to, housemates trying to decide which of two TV\u2019s to buy, etc.\u00a0 In settings like those, the pool of money that is collected from people voting would be divided equally and then redistributed to the participants. \n My hope is that a few of you might be inspired to give this sort of voting scheme a try.\u00a0 If you do, I definitely want to hear about how it works out!"], "link": "http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/31/an-alternative-to-democracy/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://papers.ssrn.com/": 1, "http://www.ust.hk/": 1, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1, "http://www.glenweyl.com/": 1, "http://www.freakonomics.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Freakonomics"}, {"content": ["If there is one thing that politicians love to do it\u2019s to promise people things now and not worry about how we will pay for those promises until sometime far into the future, when some other politician is on the hook to balance the budget.\u00a0 \n We see this all the time in the form of budget deficits in the federal government, and also with the accounting tricks used on the Social Security Trust Fund. \n These sorts of shenanigans get less press at the state and local level because many state and local governments are required to have balanced budgets ( this paper by my thesis adviser Jim Poterba lays out some of the details).\u00a0 There are, of course, ways for states to get around the balanced-budget provisions.\u00a0 The method that currently casts the greatest shadow over the future is underfunded pensions.\u00a0 State governments promise generous retirement packages to state employees, but use accounting tricks to avoid recognizing the full value of what taxpayers will owe in the future to cover those debts. \n So how big is this hidden burden?\u00a0 In a new paper , economists Robert Novy-Marx and Josh Rauh try to figure it out.\u00a0 Their conclusion: Covering the shortfall due to underfunded state and local pensions would require an average increase in taxes of $1,365 per year for every taxpayer. \n This is not the biggest number ever \u2013 I actually would have guessed the number would be larger \u2013 but it is definitely something to complain about.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve never thought about unfunded public pensions, then what you\u2019ve discovered is that if you are the average taxpayer, you should think of yourself as being $1,365 per year poorer than you thought you were just a few minutes ago. \n That is one expensive blog post."], "link": "http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/30/one-more-thing-to-worry-about-underfunded-public-pensions/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://economics.mit.edu/": 1, "http://ntj.tax.org/": 1, "http://rnm.rochester.edu/": 2, "http://www.stanford.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Freakonomics"}, {"content": ["(Photo: Keith Allison) \n Much has been made of the plan the Oklahoma City Thunder followed in building a title contender.\u00a0 Here are the basic steps the Thunder\u00a0supposedly followed: \n \n Lose a bunch of games across a few seasons, which allows a team to accumulate lottery picks \n Draft \u201cstars\u201d with lottery picks \n Sign \u201cstars\u201d to long-term contracts \n Win a title (or more) \n \n The Thunder did well with step one.\u00a0 Starting with their last two seasons in Seattle in 2006-07, this franchise had three seasons where it won 31 games, 20 games, and 23 games.\u00a0 \n These performances primarily led to the following four high picks in the draft: \n \n 2007: Kevin Durant (2 nd pick overall), Jeff Green (5 th pick overall, a pick acquired in the trade of Ray Allen ) \n 2008: Russell Westbrook (4 th pick overall) \n 2009: James Harden (3 rd pick overall) \n \n The next step was to sign each \u201cproductive\u201d player to a long-term contract.\u00a0 \n \n Durant signed a maximum contract in 2010 .\u00a0\u00a0 \n Green was apparently not deemed worthy of a significant long-term contract (and this conclusion is consistent with the statistical evidence ), so he was traded to Boston in February of 2011. \n In January of 2012, Westbrook also signed a maximum contract .\u00a0 \n \n And then this past week\u2026 Harden wasn\u2019t offered a maximum contract. And Harden refused to sign the offer the Thunder made.\u00a0 So now Harden has been traded to the Rockets.\u00a0 \n Oops!\u00a0 Apparently the Thunder didn\u2019t have the money to sign all three \u201cproductive\u201d players to maximum contract. \u00a0And given this constraint, the Thunder had to make a choice.\u00a0 \n The choice the Thunder made was to sign Durant and Westbrook to maximum contracts and to try and get Harden with something less. One might argue this was a good choice, afterall\u2026 \n \n Durant appeared in the All-Star game in 2010, 2011, and 2012 and was a First Team All-NBA selection in each of these seasons as well. \n Westbrook appeared in the All-Star game in 2011 and 2012 and was a Second Team All-NBA selection in these seasons as well. \n Harden has never been an All-Star and has never been voted to the All-NBA team. \n \n Beyond awards, we also see: \n \n Durant has averaged 26.3 points per game in his career and led the NBA in scoring per game the past three seasons. \n Westbrook has averaged 19.0 points per game in his career and finished 5 th in the NBA in scoring per game this past season. \n Harden has only averaged 12.7 points per game in his career.\u00a0 And this past season he only averaged 16.8 points per game this past season. \n \n So given the Thunder\u2019s budget constraint, it makes sense to pay Durant and Westbrook and let Harden depart. \n Then again,\u00a0awards in the NBA are driven by scoring totals .\u00a0 And unfortunately, a player\u2019s contribution to wins is about more than how many points a player scores. \n To see this, let\u2019s look at the Thunder\u2019s Wins Produced ( calculation ) in 2011-12 ( numbers from The NBA Geek ).\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Thunder 2011-12 \n \n \n Games \n Played \n \n \n Minutes \n Played \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Wins Produced \n per 48 minutes (WP48) \n \n \n Wins \n Produced \n \n \n \n \n Kevin Durant \n \n \n 66 \n \n \n 2546 \n \n \n 0.226 \n \n \n 11.97 \n \n \n \n \n James Harden \n \n \n 62 \n \n \n 1946 \n \n \n 0.263 \n \n \n 10.65 \n \n \n \n \n Serge Ibaka \n \n \n 66 \n \n \n 1792 \n \n \n 0.263 \n \n \n 9.83 \n \n \n \n \n Russell Westbrook \n \n \n 66 \n \n \n 2331 \n \n \n 0.102 \n \n \n 4.94 \n \n \n \n \n Nick Collison \n \n \n 63 \n \n \n 1307 \n \n \n 0.124 \n \n \n 3.38 \n \n \n \n \n Thabo Sefolosha \n \n \n 42 \n \n \n 914 \n \n \n 0.172 \n \n \n 3.27 \n \n \n \n \n Daequan Cook \n \n \n 57 \n \n \n 989 \n \n \n 0.072 \n \n \n 1.48 \n \n \n \n \n Kendrick Perkins \n \n \n 65 \n \n \n 1744 \n \n \n 0.039 \n \n \n 1.41 \n \n \n \n \n Cole Aldrich \n \n \n 26 \n \n \n 173 \n \n \n 0.21 \n \n \n 0.76 \n \n \n \n \n Nazr Mohammed \n \n \n 63 \n \n \n 692 \n \n \n 0.041 \n \n \n 0.59 \n \n \n \n \n Ryan Reid \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n 17 \n \n \n 0.196 \n \n \n 0.07 \n \n \n \n \n Eric Maynor \n \n \n 9 \n \n \n 137 \n \n \n -0.016 \n \n \n -0.05 \n \n \n \n \n Royal Ivey \n \n \n 34 \n \n \n 354 \n \n \n -0.034 \n \n \n -0.25 \n \n \n \n \n Reggie Jackson \n \n \n 45 \n \n \n 501 \n \n \n -0.029 \n \n \n -0.31 \n \n \n \n \n Lazar Hayward \n \n \n 26 \n \n \n 141 \n \n \n -0.121 \n \n \n -0.36 \n \n \n \n \n Derek Fisher \n \n \n 20 \n \n \n 407 \n \n \n -0.071 \n \n \n -0.61 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \n \u00a0 \n \n \n Team Wins Produced \n \n \n 46.77 \n \n \n \n \n The Thunder won 47 games last season. And about 32 of these wins can be linked to the play of Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka .\u00a0 Yes, Westbrook \u2013 who produced less than five wins last season \u2013 was not ranked in the top three on the Thunder last season.\u00a0Westbrook was in the top three in 2010-11 , but his Wins Produced per 48 minutes of 0.153 that season could be thought of as good (average WP48 is 0.100) but not outstanding (a 0.200 mark is consider the level of a \u201cstar\u201d).\u00a0 \n So what makes Harden so much more productive than Westbrook? The key is shooting efficiency.\u00a0 Scoring totals are driven by how many shots a player takes and how often those shots go in the basket.\u00a0 Players \u2013 like Glenn Robinson and Stephon Marbury (and yes, this observation is classified as \u201cfactorial\u201d \u2013 have understood for a very long time that scoring gets a player paid and wins a player awards. So it literally pays for a player to look for his shot. Last season, Westbrook finished 3 rd in the NBA in field goal attempts per game.\u00a0But when we turn to shooting efficiency \u2013 and we can consider effective field goal percentage or true shooting percentage \u2013 we see a player that was only average last year.\u00a0 And across his entire career he is below average for a point guard.\u00a0 \n Meanwhile, Harden is well above average with respect to shooting efficiency (and this is what drives his lofty Wins Produced mark).\u00a0 \n So why does Westbrook shoot so much?\u00a0 Well one obvious explanation is that Westbrook is the Thunder\u2019s point guard.\u00a0 So many possessions require Westbrook to decide who gets to shoot.\u00a0 Given the incentives facing NBA players, Westbrook seems to make the same decision that was often made by players like Stephon Marbury and Allen Iverson .\u00a0 Yes, Westbrook has often decided that it would be a good idea that he shoot.\u00a0 \n This decision had certainly helped Westbrook get a maximum contract.\u00a0 But it has also resulted in Harden moving to Houston. \n And this means the Thunder\u2019s path to a title (i.e. step #4 above) has been derailed.\u00a0 Yes, the Thunder are still an above average team.\u00a0 But Harden\u2019s production of wins will be very difficult to replace.\u00a0 So for the 2012-13 season, it doesn\u2019t look like the Thunder will be favored to get back to the NBA Finals. \n All of this should serve a cautionary tale for those franchises who seek to follow the Thunder\u2019s path.\u00a0 Losing NBA games \u2013 as the Charlotte Bobcats demonstrated last year \u2013 doesn\u2019t appear to be difficult.\u00a0 The rest of the Thunder\u2019s game plan, though, is not so easy.\u00a0 It is difficult to: \n \n draft top talent in the lottery: \u00a0\u00a0 Most lottery picks aren\u2019t stars .\u00a0 We can see this in Oklahoma City, who spent high draft picks on Green and Westbrook (and again, Westbrook doesn\u2019t produce enough to be considere a \u201cstar\u201d).\u00a0 \n know which players to sign to long tersm contracts: \u00a0Since all lottery picks aren\u2019t equal, teams need to know which players to sign to long-term contracts.\u00a0 Maximum contracts are a great deal for any team \u2013 whether in small or large markets \u2013 when the player produces wins in large quantities.\u00a0But these are not great deals for pseudo-stars like Westbrook. \n \n Oklahoma City has experienced both pitfalls.\u00a0 But with both Durant and Harden, they had the talent to compete for a title.\u00a0 But their inability to recognize that Harden \u2013 not Westbrook \u2013 was the key to the team\u2019s future has probably led the Thunder off their path to a title.\u00a0 \n All of that suggests the Oklahoma City model may not be the best plan for teams to follow.\u00a0 Yes, the losing part is easy.\u00a0 But turning all the losing into productive players is difficult.\u00a0 And since teams \u2013 as the Spurs have demonstrated \u2013 can find productive players outside the lottery, maybe teams should focus less on step #1 (i.e. losing a bunch of games) and more on locating and keeping the productive players that can help a team contend for a championship."], "link": "http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/29/the-oklahoma-city-thunder-stumble-while-following-the-oklahoma-city-thunder-plan/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://sports.go.com/": 1, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1, "http://wagesofwins.com/": 3, "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/": 1, "http://www.freakonomics.com/": 3, "http://espn.go.com/": 1, "http://www.thenbageek.com/": 5}, "blogtitle": "Freakonomics"}, {"content": ["(Photo: League of Women Voters of California LWVC) \n From mid-July to mid-October, I became\u00a0addicted\u2014to the Presidential election.

Here\u2019s your host, Stephen Dubner. \n \n [MUSIC:\u00a0 Ruby Velle and The Soulphonics - It\u2019s About Time ] \n \n DUBNER:\u00a0 Before the last presidential election, in 2008 when Barack Obama beat John McCain, Bryan Caplan published a book called\u00a0 The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies . \n \n CAPLAN: The background assumption is this: everyone understands why dictatorships choose bad policies, there\u2019s some awful jerk at the head of a country running it like it\u2019s his own personal piggy bank. The puzzle though is why democracies would choose bad policies in a similar way. So in other words, the question is: everyone can agree that dictatorships choose bad policies; it\u2019s no big intellectual puzzle as to why that would happen. But the idea that democracies, which are run by the people, or by the people elected by the people, would also make mistakes, is the puzzle. So you can think about the right way to read the title is, \u2018why even democracies choose bad policies .\u2019 \n \n DUBNER: \u00a0The cover of Caplan\u2019s book shows a flock of sheep, standing up like humans in a sort of military formation, ready to follow\u2026\u00a0someone. We the Sheeple. \n \n CAPLAN: Right, so I\u2019m really going against two different baseline wisdoms. One is with the public, just the idea that if a majority of Americans think something is a good idea then it\u2019s right. You can see this in almost any presidential debate where someone will say \u2018the American public wants this.\u2019 And the last thing the other guy is going to say is, \u2018well it\u2019s true the American public does want it, but the American public is mistaken for the following reasons\u2026\u2019\u00a0 You never want to be the politician saying that. The idea that if something is popular, it\u2019s a good idea is quite a widespread in public opinion. At the same time, I also wanted to argue against the view that\u2019s very common in economics and political science, which is that even if there\u2019s a lot of ignorance in the public, you know voters are factually mistaken on a lot of issues, nevertheless it all balances out. So that on average, if the public thinks something is a good idea, then it really is a good idea. \n \u00a0 \n DUBNER:\u00a0 Consider one topic that just about everyone cares about during the upcoming election: unemployment \u2013 or, really, employment. This issue is at the core of both the\u00a0 Obama and Romney campaigns. The argument is over how the Obama White House has done in creating jobs. But as Bryan Caplan points out, not all jobs are created equal. Some of them are what he calls \u201cmake-work\u201d jobs, and that feeds a \u201cmake-work bias.\u201d \n \n CAPLAN: I mean, make-work bias is the view that you should judge the performance of an economy based on unemployment rather than production, which especially during recession is a totally natural view. But once again, if you step back and realize, well, suppose we had thought this way in the 19th century, someone comes up with new tractors, new fertilizers, new ways of growing food. Someone else says wait a second, this is going to put farmers out of work, we should stop them, we should ban them. You know these innovations that sound good because they create more food may be bad because they\u2019re going to destroy jobs. If we listened to those people we would still be farmers. We would still be hungry because they weren\u2019t growing enough food then. Since we didn\u2019t listen to people like this, we had a huge increase in food production. We did have a large decrease in employment in agriculture, but those people and their descendants just found something else to do. Which again, is so unsatisfying to hear, because at the time you want to say, okay, well tell us specifically what will they do instead of agriculture, which is what mankind\u2019s been doing for thousands of years. And the answer really is when you\u2019re in a period of change it\u2019s very hard to say what it\u2019s going to be. All you can do is say, well, there\u2019s going to be something. The labor\u2019s valuable; someone will figure it out. \n \n DUBNER: Well, Bryan, how much of the rational voter idea is pegged simply to voting your pocketbook? In other words, voting for the candidate whose policies, or at least the policies that he promises, most closely align with your own economic interests? \n \n CAPLAN: So there are actually two separate issues here. So one of them is how clearly or unclearly people see the world. The other one is how selfishly or unselfishly they vote. A person could be very rational, but totally unselfish. A person could first of all carefully understand the world and then vote on the basis of what he thinks is best for society. A person of course could be the opposite. A person could be very confused but still voting for what he thinks will advance his selfish interests. What I do in the book is \u2014 first of all I clear some rubble away \u2014 I go over all the evidence on voter motivation showing that despite what a lot of people think, voters are shockingly unselfish. Your individual interests have very little to do with how you vote, very little to do with your views on particular issues. In general it\u2019s not true that rich people are Republican, poor people are Democrats. So there\u2019s a very slight tendency that way, but it\u2019s nothing like the picture people have of the all rich people vote Republican, all poor people vote Democrat. \n \n DUBNER: So that sounds kind of wonderful, yes? \n \n CAPLAN: So far so good. That actually does make democracy sound better. Here\u2019s the problem, though. Even though it does look like people really are voting for what they believe to be good for their society, they actually seem to know very little about that and, in fact, have a lot of very mistaken views about how to advance their interests. And I say that\u2019s actually probably the worst possible case. The worst possible thing is to have people who have good motives but bad understanding because then there\u2019s a lot of agreement and consensus about what we ought to be doing. The problem is just that what we think we ought to be doing is often ineffective or counterproductive. \n \n [MUSIC:\u00a0 Ruby Velle and The Soulphonics - It\u2019s About Time ] \n \n DUBNER: All right, so in terms of this year\u2019s presidential election, pick a plank, any plank from each candidate\u2019s economic platform. And give me an Obama plank, and give me a Romney plank. And talk about how good that policy is from an economic perspective, and then talk about its viability as a voting appeal. \n \u00a0 \n CAPLAN: I\u2019d be perfectly happy if you wanted to just give me a couple. \n \n DUBNER: Sure, so let\u2019s see. So President Obama has talked a lot about financial inequality, but also access to education let\u2019s say, right? So he has made moves toward, and talked about making more moves toward, making college more affordable in more ways toward more people. Talk to me about that idea as a piece of economic policy and then talk to me about it as a good piece of voter bait. \n \u00a0 \n CAPLAN: All right, so in terms economic policy, it\u2019s not at all clear that this is a good idea, because we already have an enormously high dropout rate, especially for marginal students. Most of, or at least a lot of the payoff from going to college comes from finishing. And yet, over the last decade or so we\u2019ve had a large rise of the number of people who start going to college, but the fraction that actually finishes has been very flat. So it seems quite likely in a way that this is just going to encourage a lot of people to waste a couple of years of life and get very little show for it. And yet, what I just said is not anything you\u2019d ever want to tell voters. You certainly don\u2019t want to get in front of a national audience and say, you know, I think too many people are going to college. A lot of people aren\u2019t very serious. You know that\u2019s just the fact, a lot of people aren\u2019t meant for college. That sounds terrible. \n \u00a0 \n DUBNER: And therefore, campaigning on the idea of sending more people to college is a great thing to campaign on.\u00a0 \n \n CAPLAN: That sounds great. And of course we\u2019re going to pay for more of the stuff sounds good. I mean, who wants to pay for the stuff. Right? And again it\u2019s not just a selfish matter of I don\u2019t want to pay for my kid. No one should have to pay! Wouldn\u2019t that be great if no one had to pay? \n \u00a0 \n DUBNER: All right, let\u2019s take something from Governor Romney\u2019s campaign. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a tax issue. Let\u2019s say that the Romney camp describes President Obama\u2019s forward-looking tax policy as wanting to raise taxes on the highest earners, whereas Governor Romney would argue, and has argued, that that would be a mistake because it would disincentivize small businesses, and maybe large. And that there comes a certain point at which raising taxes rather than, or at the expense of cutting spending is counterproductive. How does that rank as an economically sound or unsound issue in your view, and how does it rank again, as, again, voter bait? \n \u00a0 \n CAPLAN: That one\u2019s kind of funny, because if you take a look at voters\u2019 views on government spending, they\u2019re literally contradictory. Voters in general favor lower spending overall, but for virtually every category of spending they want to spend more. So this is the kind of thing where if \u00a0you say it right almost anything can be good, if you say it wrong almost anything can be bad. When a politician says we need to cut spending, that is a popular appeal. The only problem is if someone says cut which kind of spending? Oh, let\u2019s cut the waste. Can you identify the waste specifically, is there something that it actually is? You know that\u2019s the problem. I mean, I would say that in general, Republicans try to tap into the general public desire for lower spending. They also try to very carefully tap in to the public\u2019s resistance to cutting any particular kind of spending. So even though Republicans know very well that to really cut spending you\u2019ve got to cut entitlements, you know, you\u2019ve got to get Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid under control. Those are really the fast-growing areas of spending. But Republications are very carefully electorally not to name any of those because people are going to say wait, when I said cut spending, I didn\u2019t mean cut any of the spending we like, which are basically all of them, except for foreign aid. \n \n [MUSIC: Lord Echo - Things I Like to Do]  \n \n DUBNER: \u00a0Coming up: my Freakonomics partner Steve Levitt talks about\u00a0his\u00a0voting history. \n \n Steven LEVITT: I voted for Obama because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history. \n \n DUBNER: And? \u00a0 \n LEVITT: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to bother voting this election. \n \n ANNOUCNER: From WNYC and APM, American Public Media: This is Freakonomics Radio. Here\u2019s your host, Stephen Dubner. \n \n [MUSIC: Glenn Crytzer and his Syncopators - Witching Hour Blues]  \n \n DUBNER:\u00a0 Today on Freakonomics Radio we\u2019re talking with economist Bryan Caplan, author of\u00a0 The Myth of the Rational Voter.\u00a0 He is not a huge fan of our current political system. \n \n CAPLAN: If you\u2019re a successful politician, you know you don\u2019t succeed by figuring out what\u2019s really going on in the world and trying to explain it to people. You need to find out what people want to hear and then tell it to them. Successful politicians instinctively are trying to read people, trying to read their faces, what does this person want me to say to him, and that\u2019s how they win. Economists often look down on politicians and sort of mock them for being incompetent. I have a very different view. I think they\u2019re extremely competent, it\u2019s just they\u2019re competent in a skill that economists don\u2019t appreciate. They are people who win these incredibly competitive races to get a job that thousands of people would love to have, maybe millions of people would love to have. They have some incredible skills, it\u2019s just their skills are not figuring out what\u2019s really going on, or deciphering the best research around. Their skill is finding out what the public wants to hear and saying it to them in a way that\u2019s emotionally compelling.\u00a0 \n \n DUBNER: So what bothers you more, that electoral candidates give the people what the people want \u2014 or seem to want \u2014 or that people who seem to want what they seem to want? \n \n CAPLAN: That\u2019s a very good question. Because ultimately the source of the problem is that people are so confused in their views of how the economy and other things work, which means that a politician who wants to win has to actually say these things. People have often said that politics has been the religion of the 20th century, and I think there\u2019s a lot to that. In the same way that people get attached to a religion, they get attached to a political party. And once you\u2019re part of it, you don\u2019t want to hear someone talking about the horrible things that your religion or your party did in the past. You don\u2019t want to go and say the people who now run it might be morally questionable, or hypocritical, or just wrong. Instead, you want to find a sense of community with a bunch of like-minded people. You all tell each other how wonderful you are and try to defeat your Satanic enemies who for some strange reason continue to dispute the truth that you have obtained. \n \n [MUSIC:\u00a0 Ruby Velle and the Soulphonics - Agenda ] \n \u00a0 \n [MAN ON THE STREET TAPE]  \n \n DUBNER:\u00a0 People are always talking about the dispiritingly low voter turnout rate in the U.S. \u2014 it\u2019s less than 60 percent for a Presidential election. But after hearing Bryan Caplan talk for a while, you may ask yourself a different but equally dispiriting question: why is voter turnout even\u00a0that\u00a0high? I asked my Freakonomics friend and co-author Steve Levitt about this recently. He\u2019s an economist at the University of Chicago. \n \n DUBNER: So Levitt, how can you in your life, when you wander around, tell the difference between a smart person and a not-so-smart person? \n \n LEVITT: Well, one good indicator of a person who\u2019s not so smart is if they vote in a presidential election because they think their vote might actually decide which candidate wins. \n \n DUBNER: Well that sound anti-American doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s a terrible heresy you\u2019re saying aloud. \n \n LEVITT: Well, you know us, Dubner, we try to tell the truth. And the fact is that there has never been and there never will be a vote cast in a presidential election that could possibly be decisive. And one thing we see for sure, and we saw it in the Gore versus Bush election is that if it\u2019s even within thousands of votes it\u2019s not the votes themselves that decide the election, because nobody can figure out how many votes were cast. It\u2019s the courts that always decide, the judges that always decide. It\u2019s virtually impossible that any vote you cast in a national election could ever actually be decisive.\u00a0 \n \n DUBNER: But don\u2019t you think that people pretty much know that by now, people are aware of the difference between electoral versus popular vote. And you know, if you live in a state like I do, New York, or you do, Illinois, it\u2019s kind of a forgone conclusion. So let\u2019s assume that most people kind of think about that and know that, what drives them to do it anyway? I mean, people complain about low voter turnout, it sounds like you\u2019re saying it\u2019s strange it\u2019s even as high as it is, around fifty percent. \n \n LEVITT: Yeah, so I think you\u2019re right that most people understand that their vote doesn\u2019t really matter for the election, which is exactly why I said it\u2019s only the not so smart people who vote because they\u2019re actually going to influence the election. I think the reason most people vote, and the reason I occasionally vote is that it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun to vote, it\u2019s expressive, and it\u2019s a way to say the kind of person you are, and it\u2019s a way to be able to say when something goes wrong when the opponent wins, \u201cwell I voted against that fool.\u201d Or when something goes right when you voted for a guy to tell your grandchildren, \u201cwell I voted for that president.\u201d So there\u2019s nothing wrong with voting. I think you can tell whether someone\u2019s smart of not so smart by their reasons for voting.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n DUBNER: Why did you vote for Obama for president in 2008? \n \n LEVITT: So I voted for Obama because I wanted to tell my grandchildren that I voted for Obama. And I thought that he would be the greatest president in history. \n \n DUBNER: And?\u00a0 \n \n LEVITT: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to bother voting this election. \n \n DUBNER: So Levitt, some places around the world have essentially mandatory voting. Australia for one, I don\u2019t really know too many of the details about it. But as a citizen you must vote. And there are different incentives for voting, and penalties for not voting. Do you like that idea for here? \n \n LEVITT: I think it\u2019s totally backwards. Why would you want people who aren\u2019t interested in voting, why would you want to compel them? These are either people who are uninterested in voting, uninformed, indifferent between the candidates. Those are exactly the wrong people to try to get to vote. If anything I think you want to go in the other direction and find ways to let people who care a lot vote repeatedly. That\u2019s really more in the spirit of trying to get to the right answer. That way you get the people who have the strongest convictions acting most aggressively to express those convictions. \n \n [MUSIC:\u00a0 Ruby Velle and the Soulphonics - Agenda ] \n \n [MAN ON THE STREET TAPE]  \n \n [CREDITS] \n \u00a0 This is a transcript of the Freakonomics Radio podcast \u201c We the Sheeple . \u201d"], "link": "http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/25/we-the-sheeple-full-transcript/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.freakonomics.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Freakonomics"}, {"content": ["(Photo: umstwit) \n In a new working paper ( PDF ; abstract ), economists David G. Blanchflower , Andrew J. Oswald , and Sarah Stewart-Brown argue that you actually are what you eat: \n Humans run on a fuel called food. \u00a0Yet economists and other social\u00a0scientists rarely study what people eat. \u00a0We provide simple evidence\u00a0consistent with the existence of a link between the consumption of\u00a0fruit and vegetables and high well-being. \u00a0In cross-sectional data,\u00a0happiness and mental health rise in an approximately dose-response\u00a0way with the number of daily portions of fruit and vegetables. The\u00a0pattern is remarkably robust to adjustment for a large number of\u00a0other demographic, social and economic variables. \u00a0Well-being peaks\u00a0at approximately 7 portions per day. \u00a0We document this relationship\u00a0in three data sets, covering approximately 80,000 randomly selected\u00a0British individuals, and for seven measures of well-being (life\u00a0satisfaction, WEMWBS mental well-being, GHQ mental disorders,\u00a0self-reported health, happiness, nervousness, and feeling low). \n \n One major note: the researchers caution that reverse causality may be an issue. That is, rather than fruit and vegetables\u00a0 causing well-being, it may be that well-adjusted people prefer eating a lot of fruit and vegetables. The authors recommend additional \u201crandomized trials to explore the consequences for mental health of different levels of fruit-and-vegetable consumption.\u201d"], "link": "http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/10/25/you-really-are-what-you-eat/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.dartmouth.edu/": 2, "http://www.andrewoswald.com/": 1, "http://papers.nber.org/": 1, "http://www2.ac.uk/": 1, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Freakonomics"}, {"content": ["(Photo: Vox Efx) \n Our latest Freakonomics Radio episode is called \u201cWe the Sheeple.\u201d (You can download/subscribe at\u00a0 iTunes , get the\u00a0 RSS feed , or listen via the media player above.) The gist: politicians tell voters exactly what they want to hear, even when it makes no sense \u2014 which is pretty much all the time. \n With the Presidential election finally almost here, this is the last of our politically themed podcasts for a while. We\u2019ve previously looked at how much the President really matters (updated here ); whether campaign spending is as influential as people think; why people bother to vote (related Times column here ); whether we tell the truth in polls ; and whether we should consider importing the British tradition of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. \n \u201cWe the Sheeple\u201d features Bryan Caplan , the economist-author of  The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies . You might have read or heard from Caplan in other Freakonomics venues , including \u201c The Economist\u2019s Guide to Parenting ,\u201d in which he discussed another of his books, Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids .  \n Caplan is, to put it gently, not a fan of our current political system. At he puts it in the podcast: \n CAPLAN: You know, if you\u2019re a successful politician, you know you don\u2019t succeed by figuring out what\u2019s really going on in the world and trying to explain it to people. You need to find out what people what to hear and then tell it to them. That\u2019s what you see in debates. That\u2019s what you see voters, successful politicians instinctively are trying to read people, trying to read their faces, what does this person want me to say to him, and that\u2019s how they win. \n \n Caplan also shares with us a letter he received from a Virginia state senator after\u00a0 The Myth of the Rational Voter was published. The senator wanted to thank Caplan for \u201cconfirming by your research that my ideas about the stupidity of voters is a valid thought\u201d: \n \n In the podcast you\u2019ll also hear Steve Levitt talk about what he sees as the biggest upside of voting: \n LEVITT: I think the reason most people vote, and the reason I occasionally vote is that it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun to vote, it\u2019s expressive, and it\u2019s a way to say the kind of person you are, and it\u2019s a way to be able to say when something goes wrong when the opponent wins, \u201cwell I voted against that fool.\u201d Or when something goes right when you voted for a guy to tell your grandchildren, \u201cwell I voted for that president.\u201d So there\u2019s nothing wrong with voting. [But] I think you can tell whether someone\u2019s smart of not smart by their reasons for voting.  \n \n Levitt also tells us what he thinks of the idea of compulsory voting, as practiced in Australia and other places. FWIW, we just received an e-mail on this topic from an Australian reader named Andrew Mannion : \n There is a sense that it\u2019s a waste for those who have no interest in politics, although for most of us, voting is just a Saturday morning chore (all our elections are held on Saturdays) to be done with before watching the football or cricket. There is an upside though: with compulsory voting, there\u2019s no need for political parties to spend big dollars on getting people out to vote. Here, that\u2019s guaranteed. So what money is spent \u2013 and there\u2019s far less of that here \u2013 can be spent on selling policies. \n \n And finally, below is a list of the music that you\u2019ll hear in this episode. David Herman is our engineer and among his many skills is an excellent taste and feel for the music that elevates our podcast above the mere chatter of stationary people.
