The prototype tablet, called iBeam, is designed by Fujitsu for Docomo and contains an eye tracking module from Swedish Tobii, namely the IS-20 which was introduced earlier this year . The form factor appears a bit on the large size with a bump towards the edge where the eye tracking module is placed, sort of looks like a tablet inside another case. On the software side the tablet is running Android where a gaze marker is overlaid on the interface. Selection is performed using simple dwell activation which is known for being both stressful and error-prone. The sample apps contains the usual suspects, panning of photos and maps, scrolling browser and image viewer. Pretty neat for a prototype.    Fujitsu also demonstrated a LCD monitor with an eye tracking camera system embedded while the actual gaze estimation algorithms are running on an embedded Windows computer. This display is not using the Tobii IS20 but a system developed by Fujitsu themselves which is stated to be low-cost. Question is why they didn't use this for the tablet.

Realized I hadn't written much about what I've been up to. There's been a reason for that. One year ago I left my position at Duke University . It wasn't an easy decision. The Radiology eye tracking project I was involved with (and still is) was making good progress. I had been working long days since it started at Stanford in 2009 and we were doing pretty neat stuff with volumetric medical image datasets.   The Stanford/Duke Radiology eye tracking project and our novel approach to volumetric gaze data.  At the same time I spent nights and weekends working on the open source ITU Gaze Tracker together with Javier San Agustin. Somewhere I always had the feeling that we should get back together, great things just seemed to happen when we did. So after my grand tour of the US and countless Skype meetings over six months we had a plan. The four former PhD students from the ITU Gazegroup was to start an eye tracking company. At first we called it Senseye but later changed it to The Eye Tribe due to trademark issues.    The Eye Tribe as of Spring 2012 at the US embassy reception.   We decided early not to go for the established market. It's a red sea with a couple of fairly big players that have been working on their high tech creations for years, it's a low volume/high margin game with intricate and expensive solutions primarily for the research and disabled markets.  The Eye Tribe intends to innovate and disrupt by bringing eye tracking to post-pc devices in the consumer market. It just doesn't happen with devices that costs several thousand dollars.  After twelve months of executing our plan we recently raised funds from a group of European investors to accelerate (as covered by The Next Web ). The team has grown and we are looking to make additional hires in a near future. Perhaps you would like join the tribe and be part of something great? There's some very interesting things happening in a near future, for the skilled it's always best to get on early.  One year ago I traded a warm North Carolina for a cold Copenhagen, a relationship for loneliness, a big house for a small apartment and a sport car for a bicycle.

The PhD thesis can be downloaded here .    ABSTRACT  Modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are designed with able-bodied users in mind. Operating these interfaces can be impossible for some users who are unable to control the conventional mouse and keyboard. An eye tracking system offers possibilities for independent use and improved quality of life via dedicated interface tools especially tailored to the users\u2019 needs (e.g., interaction, communication, e-mailing, web browsing and entertainment). Much effort has been put towards robustness, accuracy and precision of modern eye-tracking systems and there are many available on the market. Even though gaze tracking technologies have undergone dramatic improvements over the past years, the systems are still very imprecise. This thesis deals with current challenges of monomodal gaze interaction and aims at improving access to technology and interface control for users who are limited to the eyes only. Low-cost equipment in eye tracking contributes toward improved affordability but potentially at the cost of introducing more noise in the system due to the lower quality of hardware. This implies that methods of dealing with noise and creative approaches towards getting the best out of the data stream are most wanted. The work in this thesis presents three contributions that may advance the use of low-cost monomodal gaze tracking and research in the field: An assessment of a low-cost open-source gaze tracker and two eye tracking systems through an accuracy and precision test and a performance evaluation.  Development and evaluation of a novel innovative 3D typing system with high tolerance to noise that is based on continuous panning and zooming. Development and evaluation of novel selection tools that compensate for noisy input during small-target selections in modern GUIs.  This thesis may be of particular interest for those working on the use of eye trackers for gaze interaction and how to deal with reduced data quality.

Two supplementary videos surfaced the other day and comes from the User Interface & Software Engineering group at the Otto-von-Guericke-Universit\u00e4t in Germany. In addition the authors, Sophie Stellmach and Raimund Dachselt , have a paper submitted for the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems \" (CHI'12). Abstracts and videos below. Abstract I (ETRA) Remote pan-and-zoom control for the exploration of large information spaces is of interest for various application areas, such as browsing through medical data in sterile environments or investigating geographic information systems on a distant display. In this context, considering a user's visual attention for pan-and-zoom operations could be of interest. In this paper, we investigate the potential of gaze-supported panning in combination with different zooming modalities: (1) a mouse scroll wheel, (2) tilting a handheld device, and (3) touch gestures on a smartphone. Thereby, it is possible to zoom in at a location a user currently looks at (i.e., gaze-directed pivot zoom). These techniques have been tested with Google Earth by ten participants in a user study. While participants were fastest with the already familiar mouse-only base condition, the user feedback indicates a particularly high potential of the gaze-supported pivot zooming in combination with a scroll wheel or touch gesture.   To be presented at the ETRA12.  Abstract II Since eye gaze may serve as an efficient and natural input for steering in virtual 3D scenes, we investigate the design of eye gaze steering user interfaces (UIs) in this paper. We discuss design considerations and propose design alternatives based on two selected steering approaches differing in input condition (discrete vs. continuous) and velocity selection (constant vs. gradient-based). The proposed UIs have been iteratively advanced based on two user studies with twelve participants each. In particular, the combination of continuous and gradient-based input shows a high potential, because it allows for gradually changing the moving speed and direction depending on a user's point-of-regard. This has the advantage of reducing overshooting problems and dwell-time activations. We also investigate discrete constant input for which virtual buttons are toggled using gaze dwelling. As an alternative, we propose the Sticky Gaze Pointer as a more flexible way of discrete input.  To be presented at the ETRA12. Abstract III (CHI) While eye tracking has a high potential for fast selection tasks, it is often regarded as error-prone and unnatural, especially for gaze-only interaction. To improve on that, we propose gaze-supported interaction as a more natural and effective way combining a user's gaze with touch input from a handheld device. In particular, we contribute a set of novel and practical gaze-supported selection techniques for distant displays. Designed according to the principle gaze suggests, touch confirms they include an enhanced gaze-directed cursor, local zoom lenses and more elaborated techniques utilizing manual fine positioning of the cursor via touch. In a comprehensive user study with 24 participants, we investigated the potential of these techniques for different target sizes and distances. All novel techniques outperformed a simple gaze-directed cursor and showed individual advantages. In particular those techniques using touch for fine cursor adjustments (MAGIC touch) and for cycling through a list of possible close-to-gaze targets (MAGIC tab) demonstrated a high overall performance and usability.

Tobii just presented a demo video showcasing their system. This is the first public demonstration where we actually get to see their eye detection visualized. One can only hope that this is the beginning of a more transparent approach from a company that previously have avoided showing the core technology in action. Judging by the video the eye region detection appears to be very robust, the dual camera setup clearly aids in reducing the frequency of false detection. For the specific application of driver drowsiness the accuracy of estimated gaze point-of-regard is less important as the primary area of interest is the degree of eye-lid closure, which in the domain is called PERCLOS (percentage of eye closure). This is potentially easier to accomplish compared to full gaze-estimation but placing the equipment inside a vehicle poses additional challenges. The imaging conditions will vary more compared to a traditional computer-display based system, for example direct sunlight, wider angles and head rotation. For a consumer safety application robustness is key, going from 90% to 99.9% detection rates is a clear challenge for all the companies attempting to push this technology into the automotive market. The application is clearly worthwhile and the manufactures want the technology, but is it ready?   On a side note, the sunglasses demonstrated in this video are lightly tainted. I did some testing last night with a pair of dark (black) Rayban and two 850nm IR lightsources (2x20 LEDs) and the eyes were barely visible. Guess it depends on the type of glasses and the illumination.."], "link": "http://gazeinteraction.blogspot.com/feeds/7439336086420166678/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nhtsa.gov/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 1, "http://gazeinteraction.blogspot.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Martin Tall On Gaze Interaction"}, {"content": ["Demonstration for eye-gaze controlled navigation. The goal was to move the the point of gaze to the center of the screen, simply put \"where you look is where it goes\". This is the popular AR.Drone quadricopter controlled with this policy using an EyeLink 2000 eye-tracker. The drone pivots left and right when the operator looks into those directions. It tilts up and down (making it fly backwards and forwards) when the operator looks up or down. EyeDrone was implemented by Lucas C Parra in C++ with much help from Michael Quintian. The chin rest here is not really needed as the basic control algorithm is inherently stable and miscalibrations are of little concern.

Their latest project has been shortlisted in the consumer category of The Enginner Awards 2011 . Congratulations on an awesome job! \"Using your eyes and where you are looking to interact with computer games represents an exciting new direction that game play can take, following the success of whole body interaction enabled by the Kinect and the Wii. The Innovation Fellowship has supported the development and demonstration of a low-cost eye tracker by De Montfort University, in collaboration with Sleepy Dog, the East Midlands games company that produced the Buzz-it controller and games. The low-cost eye tracker utilised the ITU Gazetracking library and was produced as a fully working pre-production prototype. In the project, three different games were produced to demonstrate different ways in which eye gaze can be used to make game play more immersive and exciting. This video demostrates two of them. eyeAsteroids The ship flies towards where you are looking and the space bar is used to fire. eyeShoot in the Dark!

SMI engineers have managed to squeeze two 30Hz eye tracking cameras and a high definition scene camera into the frame weighting only 75 grams. The advantage of tracking both eyes is that it enables parallax compensation where the accuracy is maintained regardless if you look close or far in the scene. In addition, binocular tracking most often yields better accuracy as it provides the opportunity to average both samples or to discard one with low validity. The HD scene camera captures 24 frames per second at 1280x960 pixels, a clear advantage. All in all, better late than never, SMI is back with a highly competitive product in the market."], "link": "http://gazeinteraction.blogspot.com/feeds/3717144713506586039/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.eyetracking-glasses.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://gazeinteraction.blogspot.com/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Martin Tall On Gaze Interaction"}]
