[Epub ahead of print] Rare variant discovery and calling by sequencing pooled samples with overlaps. Wang W , Yin X , Pyon YS , Hayes M , Li J .  Source Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA. Abstract MOTIVATION: For many complex traits/diseases, it is believed that rare variants account for some of the missing heritability that cannot be explained by common variants. Sequencing a large number of samples through DNA pooling is a cost effective strategy to discover rare variants and to investigate their associations with phenotypes. Overlapping pool designs provide further benefit because such approaches can potentially identify variant carriers, which is important for downstream applications of association analysis of rare variants. However, existing algorithms for analyzing sequence data from overlapping pools are limited.  RESULTS: We propose a complete data analysis framework for overlapping pool designs, with novelties in all three major steps: variant pool and variant locus identification, variant allele frequency estimation and variant sample decoding. The framework can be utilized in combination with any design matrix. We have investigated its performance based on two different overlapping designs, and have compared it with three state-of-the-art methods, by simulating targeted sequencing and by pooling real sequence data. Results on both datasets show that our algorithm has made significant improvements over existing ones. In conclusion, successful discovery of rare variants and identification of variant carriers using overlapping pool strategies critically depends on many steps, from generation of design matrixes to decoding algorithms. The proposed framework in combination with the design matrixes generated based on the Chinese remainder theorem achieves best overall results.

Although it is possible to estimate the average genetic effect for a group of rare variants from aggregate tests, there are potential biases, including winner's curse, selection procedures and differences between populations. Suzanne Leal and Dajiang Liu now report a new method to correct for bias in estimating the average genetic effect of a group of rare variants jointly analyzed for association consisting of a resampling-based approach and a bootstrap-sample-split algorithm ( Am. J. Hum. Genet. 91 , 585 \u2013 596 , 2012 ). They compare methods for estimating the average genetic effect and variance across a range of models in simulations, finding that the estimated variance is always less than the true locus-specific genetic variance, due to the inclusion of non-causal variants as well as causal variants with heterogeneous effects. The authors report the application of the new method to a resequencing data set of 4 genes in 1,045 individuals from the Dallas Heart Study, testing rare-variant associations with metabolic quantitative traits. The authors demonstrate the efficient estimation of average genetic effects in joint analysis of rare variants and note that estimated variance should be considered as a lower bound for the locus-specific variance. \n \n \n Also featured in Nature Genetics is another paper from deCODE. Current research should be now focused on rare variants now that sequencing is getting cheaper. I think the next wave in genomics will be using longer read platforms to look at structural variants which has the greater potential to disrupt the normal working mechanism of genetic machinery. There's probably enough robustness/redundancy built-in to the human genome to prevent catastrophic consequences for single variant or a bunch of rare variants to affect human health on a global scale. Disrupting entire regulatory mechanisms by structural variations however, seems like a surefire way to create the maddening variety of diseases states that eludes physicians attempting to cure everybody in the same way. \n \n \n \n \n \n Nat Genet. 2012 Oct 28. doi: 10.1038/ng.2437.

[2]. \n \n \n \nAbstract \n \nIn Western countries, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer of men and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Several genome-wide association studies have yielded numerous common variants conferring risk of prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed 32.5 million variants discovered by whole-genome sequencing 1,795 Icelanders. We identified a new low-frequency variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in European populations, rs188140481[A] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.90; P(combined) = 6.2 \u00d7 10(-34)), with an average risk allele frequency in controls of 0.54%. This variant is only very weakly correlated (r(2) \u2264 0.06) with previously reported risk variants at 8q24, and its association remains significant after adjustment for all known risk-associated variants. Carriers of rs188140481[A] were diagnosed with prostate cancer 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (P = 0.0059). We also report results for a previously described HOXB13 variant (rs138213197[T]), confirming it as a prostate cancer risk variant in populations from across Europe. \n \n \n \n\n \n PMID: \n 23104005 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]"], "link": "http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/feeds/8102503176776591892/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://dx.edu.sg/": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 48, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://dx.doi.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Kevin's GATTACA World"}, {"content": ["I truly believe when genome analysis becomes routine, it will easier to run the analysis on public clouds rather than supporting inhouse servers that doesn't scale with demand. \nOne strong reason is that the data needs to be shared across hospitals so that you are not locked into one institute.

In order to improve variant detection and genotype calling, raw sequence data are typically examined across many individuals. Here, we describe a method for genotype calling in settings where sequence data are available for unrelated individuals and parent-offspring trios and show that modeling trio information can greatly increase the accuracy of inferred genotypes and haplotypes, especially on low to modest depth sequencing data. Our method considers both linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and the constraints imposed by family structure when assigning individual genotypes and haplotypes. Using simulations, we show trios provide higher genotype calling accuracy across the frequency spectrum, both overall and at hard-to-call heterozygous sites. In addition, trios provide greatly improved phasing accuracy - improving the accuracy of downstream analyses (such as genotype imputation) that rely on phased haplotypes . To further evaluate our approach, we analyzed data on the first 508 individuals sequenced by the SardiNIA sequencing project. Our results show that our method reduces the genotyping error rate by 50% compared to analysis using existing methods that ignore family structure.

Here, we describe, implement, and evaluate a likelihood-based framework for analysis of next generation sequence data in family samples. Our framework is able to identify variant sites accurately and to assign individual genotypes, and can handle de novo mutation events, increasing the sensitivity and specificity of variant calling and de novo mutation detection. Through simulations we show explicit modeling of family relationships is especially useful for analyses of low-frequency variants and that genotype accuracy increases with the number of individuals sequenced per family. Compared with the standard approach of ignoring relatedness, our methods identify and accurately genotype more variants, and have high specificity for detecting de novo mutation events. The improvement in accuracy using our methods over the standard approach is particularly pronounced for low-frequency variants. Furthermore the family-aware calling framework dramatically reduces Mendelian inconsistencies and is beneficial for family-based analysis. We hope our framework and software will facilitate continuing efforts to identify genetic factors underlying human diseases. \n \n \n \n\n \n PMID: \n 23055937 [PubMed - in process]  \n Free full text"], "link": "http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/feeds/7033605522101265157/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://dx.plos.org/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://www.nih.gov/": 10}, "blogtitle": "Kevin's GATTACA World"}, {"content": ["Item 1 of 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0( Display the citation in PubMed )    \t   \t  1. \t\t\t Bioinformatics. 2012 Oct 11.

Abstract SUMMARY: CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of sequencing data produced by the next generation sequencing technologies, we have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup derived from the parallelization for up to ~24 cores and a quasi-linear speedup for up to ~8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous versions.

Despite the advances in sequencing speed, the computational discovery of structural variants is not yet standard. It is likely that many variants have remained undiscovered in most sequenced individuals. \n \nRESULTS: \nHere we present a novel internal segment size based approach, which organizes all, including concordant, reads into a read alignment graph where max-cliques represent maximal contradiction-free groups of alignments. A novel algorithm then enumerates all max-cliques and statistically evaluates them for their potential to reflect insertions or deletions. For the first time in the literature, we compare a large range of state-of-the-art approaches using simulated Illumina reads from a fully annotated genome and present relevant performance statistics. We achieve superior performance in particular for indels of length 20-100nt. This has been previously identified as a remaining major challenge in structural variation discovery, in particular for insert size based approaches. In this size range we outperform even split read aligners. We achieve competitive results also on biological data where our method is the only one to make a substantial amount of correct predictions, which, additionally, are disjoint from those by split-read aligners. \n \nAVAILABILITY: \nCLEVER is open source (GPL) and available from http://clever-sv.googlecode.com . \n \nCONTACT: \n tobias.marschall@tu-dortmund.de . \n \n PMID: 23060616 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]"], "link": "http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/feeds/6924082893572535774/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://clever-sv.googlecode.com/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://www.nih.gov/": 8}, "blogtitle": "Kevin's GATTACA World"}, {"content": ["BMC Research Notes | Abstract | Rapid phylogenetic and functional classification of short genomic fragments with signature peptides http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/5/460/abstract Sent via Flipboard  Sent from my phone"], "link": "http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/feeds/5895611380146585450/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.biomedcentral.com/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://itunes.apple.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Kevin's GATTACA World"}, {"content": ["---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Loyal Goff  CummeRbund 2.0.0 release 10/3/2012 Following the release of\u00a0 Bioconductor 2.11 , CummeRbund 2.0.0 \u00a0is now available and is a recommended update for all CummeRbund users. \u00a0  Version 2.0.0 adds a host of new options/features/bugfixes and is the first stable release version to fully support Cuffdiff2. \u00a0 More information, details, vignettes, and downloads can be found at\u00a0 http://compbio.mit.edu/cummeRbund/ . \u00a0As always, thank you for your support.   ====================================================================== CHANGE LOG ======================================================================  v2.0.0  \t Stable public release (Bioconductor 2.11)     v1.99.6  \t Notes:   \t - 'annotation' and \"annotation<-\" generics were moved to BiocGenerics 0.3.2.

One important solution is to use paired-end (PE) sequence information experimentally obtained from long-range DNA fragments (>1 kb). Here, we characterize and extend a long-range PE library construction method based on direct intra-molecule ligation (or molecular linker-free circularization) for NGS. \n \nRESULTS: \nWe found that the method performs stably for PE sequencing of 2- to 5- kb DNA fragments, and can be extended to 10-20 kb (and even in extremes, up to \u223c35 kb). We also characterized the impact of low quality input DNA on the method, and develop a whole-genome amplification (WGA) based protocol using limited input DNA (<1 \u00b5g). Using this PE dataset, we accurately assembled the YanHuang (YH) genome, the first sequenced Asian genome, into a scaffold N50 size of >2 Mb, which is over100-times greater than the initial size produced with only small insert PE reads(17 kb). In addition, we mapped two 7- to 8- kb insertions in the YH genome using the larger insert sizes of the long-range PE data. \n \nCONCLUSIONS: \nIn conclusion, we demonstrate here the effectiveness of this long-range PE sequencing method and its use for the de novo assembly of a large, complex genome using NGS short reads. \n \n PMID: 23029438 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]"], "link": "http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/feeds/7756719254777958437/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://www.nih.gov/": 12}, "blogtitle": "Kevin's GATTACA World"}, {"content": ["Item 1 of 1 ( Display the citation in PubMed ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1.

However, most existing tools for variation detection are based on command-line interface, which discourages the main end users of NGS data, such as biologists, geneticists and clinicians, from utilising the software. \n \nMETHOD AND RESULTS: \nWe have developed the SNVerGUI, a graphical user interface (GUI) based tool for variant detection and analysis. Compared with other methods for variant calling, our approach is unique in that it is applicable to both individual and pooled sequencing data. With friendly GUI, end users can easily adjust running parameters to optimise variant calling for their specific needs. SNVerGUI supports commonly used input and output file formats that allows SNVerGUI to be seamlessly integrated into common NGS data analysis pipelines. SNVerGUI is implemented in Java, which is platform-independent and therefore easy to install and run on the commonly used operating systems, such as Linux, Mac, and Windows. Using two real datasets, we have shown that SNVerGUI is capable of analysing very high volume NGS data in a feasible time on personal computers. \n \nCONCLUSIONS: \nSNVerGUI is a fast and easy desktop GUI tool for the identification of genomic variants from pooled sequencing and individual sequencing data. Using this software, users can perform sophisticated variant detection by simply configuring several parameters in a friendly graphical user interface. SNVerGUI makes variant analysis as simple and effortless as possible, and we expect it to become popular among geneticists, clinicians, and biologists. SNVerGUI can be freely downloaded from http://snver.sourceforge.net/snvergui/ and will be continuously updated upon users' feedback. \n \n PMID: 23024288 [PubMed - as supplied by publisher]"], "link": "http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/feeds/1994532953921625288/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://www.nih.gov/": 6, "http://snver.sourceforge.net/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Kevin's GATTACA World"}, {"content": ["Item 1 of 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0( Display the citation in PubMed )    \t   \t  1. \t\t\t Eur J Hum Genet. 2012 Sep 26. doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2012.194. [Epub ahead of print] Familial cosegregation of rare genetic variants with disease in complex disorders. Helbig I , Hodge SE , Ottman R .  Source Department of Neuropediatrics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, Kiel, Germany. Abstract Family-based designs are increasingly being used for identification of rare variants in complex disorders. This paper addresses two questions related to the utility of these designs. First, under what circumstances are rare disease-related variants expected to cosegregate with disease in families? Second, under what circumstances is a disease-variant association expected to be greater in studies restricted to familial cases than in studies of unselected cases? To investigate these questions, we developed a probability model of disease causation involving two loci. To address cosegregation, we examined the probability that an affected first-degree relative of a variant-carrying proband would also carry the variant. We find that this probability increases with increasing odds ratio (OR) for the variant, but declines with increasing sibling recurrence risk ratio (\u03bb(s)). For example, under reasonable assumptions, the 15q13.3 microdeletion in idiopathic generalized epilepsy, with an OR estimate of 68 in large case-control studies, is expected to be present in >95% of affected first-degree relatives of variant-carrying probands. However, for a variant with OR=5, the probability an affected relative has the variant ranges from 82% (when \u03bb(s)=2) to 58% (when \u03bb(s)=50). We also find that restriction of a study to familial cases does not necessarily increase a rare variant's association with disease, especially if \u03bb(s) is high and the variant contributes little to overall disease familial aggregation. These findings provide guidance for the design of family-based studies of rare variants in complex disorders.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 26 September 2012; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2012.194.

To carry out analysis on gut microbial content in patients with type 2 diabetes, we developed a protocol for a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) and undertook a two-stage MGWAS based on deep shotgun sequencing of the gut microbial DNA from 345 Chinese individuals. We identified and validated approximately 60,000 type-2-diabetes-associated markers and established the concept of a metagenomic linkage group, enabling taxonomic species-level analyses. MGWAS analysis showed that patients with type 2 diabetes were characterized by a moderate degree of gut microbial dysbiosis, a decrease in the abundance of some universal butyrate-producing bacteria and an increase in various opportunistic pathogens, as well as an enrichment of other microbial functions conferring sulphate reduction and oxidative stress resistance. An analysis of 23 additional individuals demonstrated that these gut microbial markers might be useful for classifying type 2 diabetes."], "link": "http://kevin-gattaca.blogspot.com/feeds/1422878365957292303/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nature.com/": 35, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "https://s100.copyright.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Kevin's GATTACA World"}]
