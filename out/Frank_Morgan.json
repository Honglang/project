The most memorable hand for me involved a squeeze play for a small slam in Notrump. I was North.\u00a0When the dummy came down, it looked like the contract depended on the Club finesse, but East was looking suspicious. I asked myself if there was any way to make it if East had the Club King, and I realized he could be squeezed. To keep that option open and rectify the count, I let the Spade King take the trick. He puzzled over the continuation, convincing me he had the Club King. When he finally led a red card, I ran the nine red winners, ending with Spade A and Clubs Q 3 in dummy and Spades J 8 and Club A in hand. On the ninth trick, East, holding Spades Q 10 and Clubs K 6 agonized over the discard as hoped. I turned to him and mumbled quietly, it doesn\u2019t matter. When he finally discarded the Club 6, I came to the Club A in hand and watched him play his Club King under my Ace, leaving the dummy\u2019s Spade A and Club Q good for the last two tricks. Of course if he had discarded the Spade 10, I would have played the Spade Ace dropping his Q, leaving the Club A and Spade J in my hand good. What he should have done was discard the Club 6 2 early on, leaving some doubt when he could have discarded the Spade 10 at the end, keeping the Spade 6 with his Q. \n It could have been easier. At other tables East bid, pegging him for all the missing cards. And of course if he doesn\u2019t lead the Spade, it is easy to set up a Club trick even if the finesse loses.

One could conjecture a similar result in 3D. \n \u00a0Theorem . For a double planar cell of prescribed areas A1, A2, consisting of three interfaces of prescribed mass meeting at two points, the configuration of least energy, computed for each interface as the integral of the tension with respect to arclength, is given by three circular arcs of constant density, as in Figure 1. The angles at which they meet are determined by tension equilibrium and their curvatures k i and tensions t i satisfy \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 k 1 t 1 = k 2 t 2 + k 3 t 3 . \n This is the same as the energy minimizing cluster for two immiscible fluids inside a third. \n  \n Figure 1.\u00a0An energy-minimizing double cell consists of three circular arcs in equilibrium. Figure from Slobozhanin and Alexander . \n Remark . Even if the enclosed masses instead of areas are prescribed, the minimizer will still be minimizing for whatever areas it has and will hence have the stated form. If total mass rather than the mass of each interface is prescribed, then each interface will have the same density and tension and the double cell will be the same as the energy minimizing soap bubble cluster, with angles of 120 degrees. \n Proof . A minimizer has constant density on each interface (because on any fixed curve of prescribed mass, constant density uniquely minimizes energy, because tension is a strictly convex function of density). Circular arcs are best. A fortiori , the minimizer minimizes weighted length, with a different weighting constant for each interface, which is the immiscible fluids problem. \n Remark . The immiscible fluids problem can be posed in great generality in geometric measure theory [M1, Chapter 16], allowing very general, disconnected regions. That the minimizer still takes the above form can be proved by the same simple argument that Hutchings [M2] provided for the case when all weightings are equal, the \u201cdouble soap bubble problem,\u201d as was pointed out by Cotton and Freeman [CF, \u00a72.1]. \n [CF]\u00a0 Andrew Cotton and David Freeman, The double bubble problem in spherical and hyperbolic space, Intern.
