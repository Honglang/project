Some good food for thought, I hope. As always, there is more to be said on the matter itself, on the debate, and on other\u201dmeta\u201d matters, but it is also useful to put it now in the background for a while, to continue to think about quantum fault tolerance in the slow pace and solitude, as I am used to, and also to move on in other fronts, which were perhaps neglected a little. \n Here are the links to the eight posts:\u00a0My initial post\u00a0\u201d Perpetual Motion of The 21st Century? \u201c\u00a0was followed by three posts by Aram. The first\u00a0\u201d Flying Machines of the 21st Century? \u201c\u00a0the second\u00a0\u201d N ature does not conspire  \u201c\u00a0and the third \u201c The Quantum super-PAC . \u201c\u00a0We had then two additional posts\u00a0\u201d Quantum\u00a0refutations and reproofs \u201d and\u00a0\u201d Can\u00a0you\u00a0hear\u00a0the shape of a quantum computer? .\u201d\u00a0Finally we had \u00a0two conclusion posts:\u00a0\u201d Quantum repetition \u201c\u00a0and\u00a0\u201d Quantum supremacy or quantum control? \u201c \n EDP 22-27 \n We had six new posts on the Erdos Discrepancy Problem over Gowers\u2019s blog (Here is the link to the last one EDP27 ). Tim contributed a large number of comments and it was interesting to follow his line of thought. \u00a0Other participants also contributed a few comments. One nice surprise for me was that the behavior of the hereditary discrepancy for homogeneous\u00a0arithmetic progression in {1,2,\u2026,n} was \u00a0found by Alexander Nikolov and \u00a0Kunal Talwar. See this post From discrepancy to privacy and back \u00a0and the paper . Noga Alon and I\u00a0 showed \u00a0that it is\u00a0 \u00a0and at most\u00a0 , and to my surprise Alexander and Kunal showed that the upper bound is the correct behavior. The argument relies on connection with differential privacy. \n M\u00f6bius randomness and computation \n After the -prime number theorem was proved by Ben Green, and the Mobius randomness of all Walsh functions and monotone Boolean function was proved by Jean Bourgain, ( See this MO question for details ) the next logical step are low degree polynomials over Z/2Z \u00a0. (The Walsh functions are degree 1 polynomials.) The simplest case offered to me by Bourgain is the case of the Rudin-Shapiro sequence. (But for an ACC(2) result via Razborov-Smolensky theorem we will need to go all the way to polynomial of degree polylog.) I asked it over MathOverflaw. After three months of no activity I offered a bounty of 300 of my own MO-reputations. Subsequently, Terry Tao and Ben Green discussed some avenues and eventually Tao solved the problem (and earned the 300 reputation points). Here is a very recent post on M\u00f6bius randomness on Terry Tao\u2019s blog. \n Influences on large sets \n I n my post Nati\u2019s Influence \u00a0I mentioned two old conjectures (Conjecture 1 dues to Benny Chor and Conjecture 2) about influence of large sets on Boolean functions. During Jeff Kahn\u2019s visit to Israel we managed to disprove them both. The disproof is inspired by an old construction of Ajtai and Linial. \n Tel Aviv, New Haven, Jerusalem \n Last year we lived for a year in Tel Aviv which was a wonderful experience: especially walking on the beach every day and feeling the different atmosphere of the city. It is so different from my Jerusalem and still the people speak fluent Hebrew. I am now in New Haven. It is getting cold and the fall colors are getting beautiful. And it also feels at home after all these years. And next week I return to my difficult and beautiful \u00a0(and beloved) Jerusalem."], "link": "http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/the-quantum-debate-is-over-and-other-updates/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://gowers.wordpress.com/": 2, "http://paul.rutgers.edu/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://windowsontheory.org/": 1, "http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/": 8, "http://mathoverflow.net/": 2, "http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/": 2, "http://terrytao.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Combinatorics and more"}, {"content": ["Over Gowers\u2019s blog Tim and I will make an attempt to revisit polymath5.

As in my first visit to Osaka in 1999 I found Japan stunning, and this time I\u00a0was able to\u00a0share the experience with my wife. \n Kyoto: The week before FPSAC there was a workshop at RIMS devoted to convex polytopes. Some highlights: A classical result by Venkov and McMullen characterizes polytopes\u00a0whose translates tile the Euclidean d-space.\u00a0\u00a0Sinai Robins talked about his work with Nick Gravin and Dima Shiryaev about k-tilings (every point is covered k times).\u00a0 Not a full characterization yet but already some impressive results. Gunter Ziegler talked about his work with Karim Adiprasito disproving an old conjecture by Shephard which asserts that there are only finitely many projectively unique d -polytopes for every dimension d . This is false above dimension 81. \u00a0Eran Nevo talked about his solution with Satoshi Murai of the generalized lower bound conjecture and some subsequent works on triangulated manifolds. There were several talks relating Ehrhard polynomials of polytopes with enumerative combinatorics,\u00a0 and several talks on algebraic geometry, toric varieties, Fano varieties, and mirror symmetry. Here are the slides of my lecture entitled open problems on convex polytopes I\u2019d love to see solved (but some further explanations for some parts are needed). I hope to return to some of the topics of the workshop in a later post. \n Nagoya: FPSAC ( Formal power series and algebraic combinatorics ) is a central annual\u00a0 combinatorial meeting with special emphasis on enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. This year it was the 24th such event although I could have swear\u00a0that I took part in an FPSAC in Montreal already in 1985 but apparently this was a conference with a similar flavor and different name. Much is going on in enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. Cluster algebras, miraculously discovered a decade ago by Fomin and Zelevinsky are going strong in combinatorics as well as in other areas. Alternating sign matrices continue to offer amazing problems and answers. There were quite a few lectures on representation theory,\u00a0symmetric functions, random matrices,\u00a0and also on relations of enumerative combinatorics with hyperplane arrangements with polytopes and with physics. There were lectures involving massive computations and new computerized method and packages for symbolic computations \u00a0were described. Here are the slides of my lecture entitled Discrete isoperimetry: problems, results, applications and methods . The program page now contains slides for most lectures. \n What are alternating sign matrices? \n I suppose that you all know what a permutation matrix is (an n by n matrix with 0,1 entries and one non zero entry in each row and each column) and alternating sign matrices are amazing generalization of permutation matrices discovered by\u00a0William Mills,\u00a0David Robbins, and Howard Rumsey. (See also this article by Bressoud and Propp ) They are integral n by n matrices with 0,1 and -1 entries.\u00a0In every row and every columns \u00a0the non zero aliments (and there must be at least one such element) \u00a0should alternate between 1 and -1 and start and end with a \u20191\u2032. Alternating sign matrices are in one to one correspondence with monotone triangle. Thos are triangles of integers starting with a row: 1,2,\u2026,n . With the following rules: (a) all rows are strictly increasing; (b) every element in\u00a0row i is weakly between the two elements above it. \n The amazing thing is that the number of alternating sign matrices of order n is precisely \n 1!4!7!\u2026(3n-2)!/n!(n+1)!\u2026(2n-1)! \n This was a conjecture by Mills, Robbins and Rumsey and it took over a decade until it was proved by Doron Zeilberger. Later Greg Kuperberg found a short proof and by now several proofs are known. If you have some information or ideas on alternating sign matrices that you would like to share or some questions about them, or about anything else , please contribute a comment."], "link": "http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/tokyo-kyoto-and-nagoya/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/": 10, "http://www.ams.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://www.ac.jp/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Combinatorics and more"}, {"content": ["Problem: Let P be a polytope in with n facets.

Very nice! Stay tuned for a report! \n Polynomial Hirsch conjecture (polymath3): While the conjecture remains wide open there are some interesting developments. The conjecture asserts that the diameter of every d-dimensional polytope with n facets is at most polynomial in d and n. J esus de Loera and Steve Klee described simplicial polytopes which are not\u00a0 weakly vertex decomposable and the existence of non weakly k -vertex decomposable polytopes for k up to about was proved\u00a0\u00a0by H\u00e4hnle, Klee, and Pilaud in the paper\u00a0 Obstructions to weak decomposability for simplicial polytopes .

This extends Greg\u2019s work on telling unknots . Topology, provides remarkable questions in NP and coNP where proving both sides are hard. My claim to fame is replacing Joel in grading an exam in 1986 (or so) when he got married! \n High dimensional expander . My course with Alex Lubotzky on high dimensional expanders ended. A lot of nice things to tell about and we learned quite a few new things. Roy Meshulam concluded his course with a crystal clear lecture on Garland\u2019s method. Maybe we will teach it again after a year break. Meanwhile, Ori Parzanchevski promised me to write something about some recent developments over here. Stay tuned for that too. \n 16th Midrasha Mathematicae: Our yearly midrasha ran by Aner Shalev was devoted to Words and Growth . Delicious approximate groups and word maps were observed! \n Interactive quantum lecture: We had an unususal quantum seminar presentation by Michael Ben-Or on the work A multi-prover interactive proof for NEXP sound against entangled provers by Tsuyoshi Ito and Thomas Vidick. Michael ran Vidick\u2019s videotaped recent talk on the matter and from time to time he and Dorit acted as a pair of prover and the other audience as verifier.

Eyal was motivated by our poll on certainty \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d which is related to several issues in accounting . \n Mathematicians, I believe, are always looking for new areas where their models and concepts can make a difference. Physics, Economics, CS, Biology are just some examples, surely not exhausting a longer list of such areas. Although the origins of accounting emanate from mathematicians (for example: L. Pacioli, and even\u00a0 A. Cayley found interest in it), it is a fact,\u00a0 though not unexplained,\u00a0 that these days\u00a0 (almost) no mathematicians are interested in accounting and there is no field of \u201cmathematical accounting\u201d.\u00a0 In the following few paragraphs I would like to thus draw attention to accounting as a possible field for mathematicians. Surprisingly, a possibly \u201cprofitable field\u201d. I believe that accounting can be subject, inter-alia, to use of theories of Formal Systems, Information Theory, Voting\u00a0 theory, Fuzzy Logic, Graph theory and even Catastrophe theory. In brief, accounting (Financial Reporting) deals with the measurement and reporting of economic events .\u00a0 As such, it is a measurement system interlaced with an information system. (Results such as Blackwell theorem \u00a0on the comparison of information systems are of relevance). \n Financial reporting of firms, the lifeline of the Capital Markets, is dictated by \u201creporting standards\u201d. Those reporting standards are determined by \u201cstandard boards\u201d (according to voting rules and procedures, which are very interesting for analysis)\u00a0 and interpreted and evolve over time (as is the case with other languages).\u00a0\u00a0 The reports are audited by accounting firms.\u00a0 Auditing theory became more sophisticated\u00a0 but even fairly standard tools like Benford Law are not yet routine. \n Moreover, a huge debate centers on whether to adopt a rule-based system where \u201cevery\u201d possible scenario is prescribed in advance or whether to adopt a principle based system which gives\u201d freedom\u201d to every reporting entity in reflecting the economic substance of an event. \n It is well known that a rule-based systems provide greater comparability (between firms), but at the same time, as they are more rigid and make use of \u201cbright lines\u201d,\u00a0 can be more easily forced to reflect form over substance . Indeed, Bright line Accounting rules are not continuous functions and hence small changes in the description or design of an event can lead to enormous differences in the reported values. For example, given that the definition of \u201cCONTROL\u201d was based on a \u201c50% legal test\u201d ,until recently it was the case that\u00a0 if company A was holding 50.01% of the shares of company B (other holders being each\u00a0 much smaller)\u00a0 and sold only\u00a0 1.02% it could recognize a profit, due to \u201closs of control\u201d,\u00a0 as though it sold the whole holding and bought back 49.01%. Needless to say that although holding \u201conly\u201d 49.01% , A CONTROLs B (Danny Ben Shahar, Desmond Tsang and Myself are in the process of demonstrating that \u201caccounting theory of control\u201d is inconsistent with Shapley Value). \n Principle based systems, on the other hand, must make sure that its principles are common knowledge. For example, if a provision for loss regarding a claim against a firm depends on the chances of loss being \u201cProbable\u201d or\u00a0 \u201cremote\u201d or \u201creasonably possible\u201d a question arises what the preparers and users of the financial statements think about those terms. Many years ago, me and my colleague Yossi Aharoni found out-through questionnaires- that different types of agents have different probabilistic interpretations to those terms and we explained the mis-communication it can cause. I attach two simple papers ( one co-authored with Danny Ben Shahar , the other one in hebrew ),\u00a0 that can shed some more light on the above point of view and I dare state a wish that a new field of \u201cmathematical accounting\u201d will be created ."], "link": "http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/06/19/eyal-sulganik-towards-a-theory-of-mathematical-accounting/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://portal.ac.il/": 1, "http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/": 2, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://projecteuclid.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Combinatorics and more"}, {"content": ["The Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours 2012 was released on 16 June 2012 in the United Kingdom and Tim Gowers was knighted for \u201cservices to mathematics\u201d!

The IMU meetings have different formats and usually they are very successful and this year was no exception. So I will tell you a little more about it later.\u00a0Five more short items for today: \n \n Last\u00a0Wednesday two new research centers were inaugurated. Here at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem the new Quantum Information Science Center \u00a0 had its kick-off workshop \u00a0on Wednesday. Here are the slides of the lecture I gave\u00a0 devoted to my debate with Aram Harrow . (As always, remarks and corrections are most welcome.) \n In Haifa at the Technion\u00a0, the newly founded Technion-Microsoft Electronic-Commerce Research Center held a one day workshop on electronic-commerce . \n There is a new research blog Windows on Theory \u00a0devoted to research in theoretical computer science. It is run by theory people from Microsoft Research, most from the Silicon Valley. The last post mentioned a nice story of Ehud Friedgut about hitting a rotating sphere from a 1997 paper of mine. \n Last month, Luca Trevisan\u00a0was the Erdos\u2019 Lecturer of the center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, here at HU. Luca is one of the world leaders in theoretical computer science and also the author of a famous blog: In Theory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Luca Trevisan\u2019s blog\u2019s celebration of\u00a0Alan Turing\u2019s 100th birthday , spanned over several posts, \u00a0will be\u00a0devoted to a big part of\u00a0Turing\u2019s life\u00a0 \u2013 being gay. \n Starting on monday: A conference on graph limits (\u201c Graphs and Analysis \u201c) at IAS, Princeton. Many great talks are expected.\u00a0Our blog is negotiating with Itai\u00a0Benjamini for letting us post the slides of his lecture on Euclidean versus graph metrics. \n \n The Bar-Ilan Meeting \n David Kazhdan gave a talk about the classic master equation. \n The abstract of his lecture read: \n \n We formalize the construction by Batalin\u00a0and Vilkovisky\u00a0of a solution of the classical master equation associated with a classical action, a regular function on a nonsingular\u00a0affine variety. We introduce the notion of stable equivalence of solutions and prove that a solution exists and is unique up to stable equivalence. A consequence is that the associated BRST\u00a0cohomology\u00a0groups are independent of choices and are uniquely determined up to unique isomorphism by the classical action. \n \n David, however, decided to give a talk about the background to a talk described in the abstract. He gave a quick mathematical introduction to classical and quantum mechanics, leading to the Faddeev-Popov method, described in as\u00a0elementary and jargon-free as possible \u00a0differential geometry language. Beautiful talk! \n Let\u2019s\u00a0glimpse\u00a0at the lecture: Quantum mechanics is about calculating integrals of the form While classical mechanics is the study of the\u00a0stationary points\u00a0of . (In cases where the stationary point is unique, the derivative at\u00a0a stationary\u00a0point is well-defined and the Hessian is non-zero, and other pleasant things occur \u00a0we can approximate the integral by a normalized value of .) \n When there is a group\u00a0 G \u00a0(gauge symmetry) acting on X\u00a0\u00a0 then we can try to make the computation on the quotient X/G \u00a0. (This computation leads to expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams.) Faddeev-Popov method is based on the idea: don\u2019t take quotients but rather enlarge your space! So you replace X by the Cartesian product of X with the associated Lie algebra of G . (Here, a structure\u00a0of a \u201csupermanifold\u201d emerges.) At this point a) some differential geometry enters into the picture, b) this allows to the master equation promised in the title to emerge, and c)\u00a0The computation has some cohomological nature. \n After David\u2019s talk Jonathan Wahl gave a talk\u00a0 on Topology versus geometry of complex singularities. There is a famous book by Milnor on this topic and a lot have been learned since. Then there was a brief prize awards session. Our annual\u00a0\u00a0Erdos\u2019 prize for a mathematician under 40,\u00a0was awarded\u00a0to Irit\u00a0Dinur, and the\u00a0Haim Nessiyahu\u00a0prize for excellent doctoral thesis was awarded to\u00a0Alexander Sodin\u00a0on his work on random matrices.\u00a0\u00a0Ran Raz\u00a0gave a talk about PCP and, in particular, on Irit\u2019s contribution.\u00a0 This is the 20th anniversary of the PCP Theorem. Heartily Congratulations to Irit and Sasha. \n And then we separated into ten \u00a0parallel sessions: Algebra and number theory; Analysis; Discrete Math and Computer Science; Dynamics and Ergodic Theory; \u00a0History and Philosophy of Mathematics; Homotopy Theory; \u00a0Mathematical Education; Topology and Geometry; Probability;\u00a0Nonlinear Analysis and Optimization. To avoid being torn between too many good options my policy is usually to stay with the combinatorics session.
