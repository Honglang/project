In other cases, the individual charts have problems and the groupings make matters worse. The problem with the groups might be inconsistent colors, scales, order or other graphical elements. \n In Figure 1 the meanings of the colors in the map and the accompanying pie chart are not consistent. A reader looking at the map will see that black is used for Kentucky. The reader might assume that the black on the pie chart refers to Kentucky without reading the labels carefully. However, the black on the pie chart refers to Piedmont. Consistency of color is important in groups of graphs. \n \n  Figure 1. Inconsistent use of color.

The reader might read the labels of one of the charts and assume that the order of the other is the same. This is a case where two principles of effective graphs contradict one another. The first principle is that alphabetical ordering is rarely best and that ordering by size is often more informative. The second is that groups of charts need consistent ordering. My advice when two principles conflict is to choose the principle that is least likely to confuse or mislead the reader. In this case I suggest ordering one of the variables by size and using the same ordering for the other. In this case I would order revenue by size and use the revenue ordering for profits as well. \n  \n  Figure 3. Inconsistent order. Note that the scales of the revenue plot and the profit plot differ since the range of their values is so different. Click to enlarge. \n In the preceding example we said that scales must be consistent and here they are not. There are times when the range of values in each of the charts makes consistent scales impractical since most of the variation in one of the variables would be lost. We used the caption to call attention to the fact that the scales differ. \n When drawing charts and graphs it is important that the individual charts be clear, concise, and easy to understand.

The Fox News\u2019 graph is a bar graph while these graphs from Huff are line graphs. We judge the value of a bar by its length. Any length begins at zero. We judge the value of a point on a line by its position along a scale. This judgment does not depend on zero. Even if you think you judge a bar graph by the position of the top of the bar, you cannot help but see the length of the bar. \n Most other graph experts I respect also disagree with Huff on this point.

Cleveland calls the graphs with zero in these figures \u201ca waste of space that shows very little quantitative information beyond what could be conveyed in one sentence.\u201d In Edward Tufte\u2019s one day course on Information Design that I attended, Tufte said \u201cDarrell Huff was wrong.\u201d Note that the graphs with zero hide the varying rates of change in these figures, something that may be important for some audiences to know. My position is that whether zero needs to be included on graphs in which we judge position depends on the audience. For educated audiences who can be expected to read tick labels, zero is not needed. Some graphs for the general public might be misinterpreted without zero. \n Not including zero in the baseline is one way to exaggerate a trend for those who don\u2019t read labels carefully.\u00a0 Can you think of others?
