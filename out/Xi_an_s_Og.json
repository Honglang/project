The talk on ABC was again well-attended and, because this was an econometric seminar (as in Princeton ), quite lively with a flow of questions all along. (There were also a few people from Biology, for whom the focus on our consistency result was presumably less interest than for econometricians.) As in Ames, I did not manage to reach the part on empirical likelihood . Fodder for another seminar! The day ended by a meal in a superb restaurant with my favourite wine, Saint-Joseph , after which I was ready for a few hours of sleep..! And then a few hours to spend in the Art Institute of Chicago before flying back to Paris.

It is kind of funny that this happens the day I am visiting Iowa State University Statistics Department , a department that was formerly a Fisherian and thus anti-Bayesian stronghold. (Not any longer, to be sure! I was also surprised to discover that before the creation of the department, Henry Wallace, came to lecture on machine calculations for statistical methods\u2026in 1924!) \n T he reply to the discussion was rewritten and much broadened by Andrew after I drafted a more classical point-by-point reply to our four discussants, much to its improvement. For one thing, it reads well on its own, as the discussions are not yet available on-line . For another, it gives a broader impact of the discussion, which suits well the readership of The American Statistician . (Some of my draft reply is recycled in this post.) \n H ere are two interesting quotes made by Stephen Stiegler from a 1928 book by Thornton C. Fry called Probability and its Engineering Uses : \n \n \u201cWe would be glad, if we could, to get a measure of our certainty in [scientific problems]; but there is nothing in the Theory of Probability to aid us except \u201cBayes\u2019 Theorem, which we can seldom use for the purpose because \u2026 we cannot measure the unconditional [i.e. prior] probabilities. \u2026 To such problems, then, no exact answer can be expected from the use of Bayes\u2019 Theorem; not because of any logical uncertainty as to the theorem itself*, but because we do not possess the data necessary for its use. On the other hand it is often of service in dealing with problems to which qualitative answers are acceptable [i.e. answers giving at least an order of magnitude of the uncertainty]. \n \n and \n \n \u201cDue to numerous inexact statements which have been made of it, Bayes\u2019 Theorem has been the subject of much adverse criticism, and some authorities have even gone so far as to reject it entirely. At present, however, this criticism seems to be dying out, the commonly accepted view being much the same as that stated above: that it is just as sound logically as any other part of the Theory of Probability, and may be trusted to give reliable results when we can get a grip on it. The trouble is that we so seldom can.\u201d \n \n I ndeed, I find it interesting to witness the intellectual and not so unusual position of Fry about prior distributions, a position that sruvived to this day, namely that the prior distribution cannot be determined exactly nor measured to a satisfying precision. This attitude towards the prior (in which we have no more reason to believe than in the randomness of the parameter) is often found in applied fields where scientists spend an unusual amount of space and time searching for \u201cthe\u201d prior or justifying their use of an \u201capproximation\u201d, seemingly convinced of the existence of a deus ex machina that would have chosen a prior distribution once and forever. That it primarily occurs in the physical sciences may reflect the attitude of those sciences towards imprecise or subjective modelling, even though models themselves are generally seen as temporary approximations to the \u201ctruth\u201d This kink of mental block in the perception of Bayesian analysis certainly did as much harm as the admittedly embarrassing complexity of setting and testing a prior distribution. At least in the days before cheap computing became available. \n \n \u201c. \u2026contemporary Bayesianism is in need of new foundations; whether they are to be found in non-Bayesian testing, or elsewhere. \u201d D. Mayo \n \n A s in most of her writings , Deborah Mayo gives the impression in her thorough and wide-ranging discussion on \u201cthe foundational defence of Bayesianism\u201d that most of Statistics is under threat of being overcome (or \u201cinundated\u201d) by the Bayesian perspective. (I am quite grateful for the dedication to George \u2018s memory of her comments.) We can reassure her that this is definitely not the case, even in applied fields. For instance, the fact that younger statisticians may be unaware of the passionate battles of the past century can be interpreted in a completely different light, namely as a lack of adverse reaction to the use of Bayesian or non-Bayesian perspectives. Similarly, it does not seem true (as perceived from our daily practice) that \u201cfew readers are unaware of the (\u2026) criticisms\u201d (p.3) launched at Newyman-Pearson (testing) statistics, given that the large majority of tests are indeed conducted following their principles. \n \n \u201c Bayesian testing seems to be in a state of flux. The authors\u2019 invitation to test Bayesian models, including priors, is welcome; but the results of testing are clearly going to depend on explicating the intended interpretation of whatever is being tested .\u201d D. Mayo \n \n A s a minor comment, \u201cemploy[ing] frequentist error probabilities to appraise and ensure the probative capacity, or severity, of tests, being sensitive to the actual data and claim to be inferred\u201d does not seem (to me) to support more the Neyman-Pearson methodology than the recourse of Bayesian predictives. I (we?) am certainly more agnostic than fundamentalist in this debate on foundations, as I think that, like most statisticians, philosophers should acknowledge the elusive nature of \u201ctruth\u201d in statistical problems and accept the possibility of multiverses of answers, in contrast with other sciences. Having multiple responses when faced with a given dataset is neither a sin, nor an epistemological paradox, because the map is not the territory, the data is not the model. \n I n a finally unifying theme for this discussion and reply, I stress my earlier point that there is no gold standard for the prior distribution in a given problem and hence that \u201cthe interpretation and justification for the prior probability distribution\u201d is not meaningful to the extent debated by Deborah Mayo: the prior is both a probabilistic object, standard from this perspective, and a subjective construct, translating qualitative personal assessments into a probability distribution. The extension of this dual nature to the so-called \u201cconventional\u201d priors (a very good semantic finding!) is to set a reference (hence the \u201creference priors\u201d of Bernardo and Berger) framework against which to test the impact of one\u2019s prior choices and the variability of the resulting inference. I do not find any particular difficulty in the variety of choices for those conventional priors as they simply set a standard against which to gauge our answers. In fine , assuming enough computing power is available, we can always run (frequentist, nothing else!) simulations to check for the long-term or average properties of different Bayesian procedures, provided those properties are truly the reason for the statistical analysis and not a textbook choice of an artificial loss function. \n Filed under: Books , Statistics , University life Tagged: Bayes theorem , Bayesian computation , Bayesian statistics , George Snedecor , Henry Wallace , Iowa State University , Ronald Fisher , The American Statistician , William Feller"], "link": "http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/the-anti-bayesian-moment-and-its-passing/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://xianblog.wordpress.com/": 15, "http://errorstatistics.com/": 1, "http://arxiv.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://amstat.tandfonline.com/": 2, "http://www.amazon.com/": 1, "http://www.iastate.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Xi'an's Og"}, {"content": ["Filed under: pictures , Running , Travel Tagged: Des Moines , Gray's Lake , Iowa , sunrise"], "link": "http://xianblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/sunrise-in-des-moines/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://xianblog.wordpress.com/": 8}, "blogtitle": "Xi'an's Og"}, {"content": ["I n the plane to Chicago , while being stuck on the tarmac at Roissy airport for an hour, I went through my newspapers, only to have the pleasant surprise find in the science leaflet of Le Monde that my co-author Arnaud Estoup, senior researcher at INRA in Montpellier (CBGP), was mentioned in a full page article for his work on the multi-colored Asian lady beetle ( Harmonia axyridis , HA), establishing \u201c that t he recent burst of worldwide invasions of HA followed a bridgehead scenario, in which an invasive population in eastern North America acted as the source of the colonists that invaded the European, South American and African continents, with some admixture with a biocontrol strain in Europe \u201c.
