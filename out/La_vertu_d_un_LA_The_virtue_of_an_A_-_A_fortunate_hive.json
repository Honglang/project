The concept is illustrated on the figure to the left. Signal obtained from direct reflections of interest (blue) are mixing with other waves bouncing between layers (red). They look alike except for differential attenuation in the frequency domains, different slopes in CMP gathers. Those interested could have a look at the booklet Seismic multiple removal techniques: past, present and future by Eric J. (Dirk) Verschuur . Those more patient may want to waiting for Seismic Multiple Elimination Techniques , by the same author, which should be published in June 2013.As the problem is quite complex per se, hundred of papers have been devoted to multiple elimination techniques, since the January 1948 special issue of Geophysics. A common approach consists in first computing one or several approximate models of the multiple reflections, and then trying to adaptively substract the model from the data. Such techniques usually combine an adapted representation (Fourier, Radon , different breeds of wavelets ) and a matching or separation technique. The one we finally published resides at one end of the representation/matching spectrum, to cope with the industrial partner requirements. A somewhat redundant complex wavelet tranform (and yes, combining a Morlet wavelet frame and the complex trace, so to say) and a very simple sliding window 1-tap adaptive filter estimation on the complex scalogram, to adapt and remove a template disturbance signal from the original seismic trace. Maybe not the most theoretically proven approach, but a decent, fancy blend of complex wavelets and adaptive filtering, and some industrialized code that works. And a milestone in a nice collaborative venture, especially with Sergi Ventosa , now at IPGP . And finally published (took 1.5 years). So here it is: \n \n \n \n Adaptive multiple subtraction with wavelet-based complex unary Wiener filters ( arxiv , doi ), page ), Geophysics, 2012, November-December \n \nSergi Ventosa, Sylvain Le Roy, Ir\u00e8ne Huard, Antonio Pica, H\u00e9rald Rabeson, Patrice Ricarte, Laurent Duval \n \n \n \n \n Abstract: Adaptive subtraction is a key element in predictive multiple-suppression methods. It minimizes misalignments and amplitude differences between modeled and actual multiples , and thus reduces multiple contamination in the dataset after subtraction. The challenge consists in attenuating multiples without distorting primaries, despite the high cross-correlation between their waveform. For this purpose, this complicated wide-band problem is decomposed into a set of more tractable narrow-band problems using a 1D complex wavelet frame. This decomposition enables a single-pass adaptive subtraction via single-sample (unary) complex Wiener filters, consistently estimated on overlapping windows in a complex wavelet transformed domain. Each unary filter compensates amplitude differences within its frequency support, and rectifies more robustly small and large misalignment errors through phase and integer delay corrections . This approach greatly simplifies the matching filter estimation and, despite its simplicity, compares promisingly with standard adaptive 2D methods, on both synthetic and field data. \n \n \nThe preprint version is available , with nice color figure, under the umbrella of Arxiv. Next in line: explore other ends of the matching/transform spectrum.

CBM is based on using real-time data to prioritize \nand to optimize maintenance resources. It enables real-time diagnosis of\n impending failures and prognosis of remaining useful life of equipment \nwithout interrupting normal operations through analyzing and \ninterpreting the measured data. Intensively used in CBM, the MA is \nconcerned with the identification of the natural mode shapes and \nfrequencies of structures or fluids under vibrational excitation. \nMulti-purpose time-frequency methods like the short-time Fourier \ntransform, the Wigner-Ville distribution or wavelets etc. are signal \nprocessing techniques which are applied in mechanical structures \nanalysis for investigating functional parameters that are evolving in \ntime like structural damages, cracks or deformations. Their usefulness \nin practice consists mainly in the fact that they are non-invasive \ntechniques. This call for papers is aiming to stimulate not only new \ninsides on the standard time-frequency techniques for signal processing \nbut also recently developed methods like non-stationary Gabor frames, \ncurvelets, adaptive wavelet families, sparse decompositions etc. with \npotential applications to dynamic data processing in manufacturing, \nmechanical structures and acoustics. Therefore, the main objective of \nthis special issue is to bring the ideas of worldwide research community\n to present the latest developments and to advance the fields of CBM and\n MA through applications of the modern time-frequency processing \ntechniques. \n \nThe following topics are of main interest : \n \n \n Time-frequency methods for diagnostics, prognostics and features extraction \n \n Time-frequency methods for modal analysis \n \n Wavelet-based vibration monitoring and control \n \n Natural frequencies identification \n \n Sparse signal analysis \n \n Online, segment-wise and parallel time-frequency implementations \n \n Assessment studies of different signal processing techniques \n \n Hardware and application constraints when building CBM systems \n \n Applications in radar, mechanics, acoustics, etc. \n \nThe specified topics should be viewed as guidelines but any original \ninterpretation of the signal processing methods for CBM and MA will be \nconsidered. \n \n Important dates: \n \n \n Manuscript due: November 30, 2012 \n \n First Round of Reviews: January 31, 2013 \n \n Second Round of Reviews: March 31, 2013 \n \n Publication date: June 1, 2013 \n \n \n Submission Guidelines: \nAuthors are invited to submit their papers via the Elsevier submission web site at http://ees.elsevier.com/sigpro/login.asp and please select the Item: \u201c Time-frequency for CBM&MA \u201d after you log in as an author.

Not two. Three would be the best practical information base] \n \nThis short post is inspired by Igor Carron 's The 2-bit Aggie weather station . Igor proposes us the three-valued (bbl) system for assessing weather conditions, with a brick put outside: brown, bright, left \n \n \n If brick is dark brown, it's a sure sign that it's raining outside. \n If the brick is bright, then it's sunny outside. \n If the brick is not there anymore, it's a tornado. \n \nThe weird machine on the right is not a brick, and is better described in The ternary calculating machine of Thomas Fowler , IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 2005, by Glusker, Hogan, and Vass. \n \n \nBender: Ahhh, what an awful dream. Ones and zeroes everywhere... and I thought I saw a two. \nFry: Don't worry, Bender: there's no such thing ... \nFuturama \n \nAmong the very few scientific results i can grasp, a very few simple ones jump to my mind and keep me amazed: \n \n \n the fact that the Wiles-Fermat theorem is almost trivial in polynomial ring (see Mason-Stothers ABC theorem , based on Wronskians for complex coefficients, showing that max(deg(A(a),deg(B(x),deg(C(x))) + 1 <= # roots (A(x)B(x)C(x)) \n Cantor's diagonal argument \n statistical Stein's lemma and paradox , and some of it's signal processing applications ( pdf ) \n the most beautiful Euler god-existing formula , involving constants pi, e, i, 1 and 0 (from utmost to least translucency) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n van der Corput Lemma for oscillatory integrals \n Pick's theorem relating inside, border points and area in lattice polygons \n and, of course, a pair of others \n \n The most radical one, pertaining to signal acquisition and representation, lies between the binary and the ternary systems: from bits to trits , from bytes to trytes. It states that the \"most efficient\" storing system is \" e \", from Euler's number, not to confuse with Mascheroni-Euler constant, gamma , (the one from the natural logarithm). I am quite surprised the binary system pervades so much the present digital world that this \"fact\" is quite often ignored. Indeed, when i try to gather some information on that topic, i generally do not remember where to start from. Which keywords (trit for \"ternary digits\" similar to bits for \"binary digits\", or \"tryte\" versus \"byte\" for the \"words\" themselves, trinary or ternary), what sources? \n \nThe basic idea is that, when trying to represent a number in concise or sparse form on d -digits (or number byte-width ), one could choose the biggest b -base (or bit-depth , the number of symbols per \"digit\") for representation. In a similar way for signal or image processing, the sparsest base or frame for a specific signal or image has this signal or image data as a vector. The simplest idea comes from minimizing the product width x depth, or e(d,b) = = db , considered as a loss function.Let us compute it for all numbers from 0 to decimal N = 999999, in different numeral systems? \n \n Decimal: b = 10, d = 6 = ceil(log( N +1)/log( b )), db = 60, \n Binary: b = 2, d = 20, db = 40, \n Ternary: b = 3, d = 13, db = 39, \n Quaternary: b = 4, d = 10, db = 40. \n \n \n \nHere we have a very local minimum at b = 3. More generalized, the objective minimizes the loss function e(b) = b/log(b) (at WolframAlpha). The non-negative real minimum is \"e\". The two potential contenders for practical arithmetics, or even physics, are 2 (binary) or 3 (ternary), the two closest integers. It is easy to note that e(2) = 2.885... while e(3) = 2.731... and e(4) = 5.771 (compare to 2.718...). This confirms the preceding decimal/binary/ternary/quaternary local minimum at 3, 2 becoming second, the ternary numeral system , is closer to the absolute minimum. So we need to add 2 and 3 and propose a \"Generalized\"-) Euler formula: \n \n \n \n \nand, more interesting, 3 should be more compact, even for three-valued logic in computer systems. The chapter Ternary computers: the setun and the setun 70 , by N. P. Brusentov and J. R. Alvarez from Moscow state university (at Google books), indicates that this is an old story: \n \n\"It is known that the ternary arithmetic has essential advantages as compared with the binary one that is used in present-day computers. In connection with this Donald Knuth assumed that the replacement of \"flip-flop\" for \"flip-flap-flop\" one a \"good\" day will nevertheless happen [1]. Now, when the binary computers predominate, it is hard to believe in a reality of such assumption, but if it would happen not only the computer arithmetic, but the informatics on the whole would become most simple and most perfect. The third value (Aristotle named it snmbebhkoV \u2013 attendant) what is very actual but hidden in binary logic, will become obvious and direct manipulated. Ternary logic has better accordance with the Nature and human informal thinking [2]. Unfortunately, the modern researches of the multivalued (non-binary) logic are formal and are not associated with practical requests.A remarkable exclusion is the experience of creating the ternary computers \"Setun\" and \"Setun 70\" at Moscow State University [3,4,5,6]. This experience convincingly confirms practical preferences of ternary digital technique. \n \nThe design of small digital machine \"Setun\" (Setun is the little river which flows into the river \"Moscow\" near the University) was initiated by member of the academy of Sciences S. L. Sobolev at 1956. It was assumed to create small, inexpensive computer, simple in use and service for schools, research laboratories, design offices and for manufacture control. For such goal at the computer center of the University there was formed a group of young men (4 MS and 5 BA). The joint seminar for engineers and programmers was organized and S. L. Sobolev, K. A. Semendjev, M. R. Shura-Bura, I. S. Berezin were its permanent participants. The problems of optimization of computer architecture and technical realization were examined and the variants of future computer were discussed.\" \nI especially like the flip-flap-flop mnemonic. \"Perhaps the prettiest number system of all,\" writes Donald E. Knuth in \nThe Art of Computer Programming, \"is the balanced ternary notation.\"This reminds of the derivatives of position. Velocity and acceleration are well known, jerk is the 3rd. Jounce is sometimes given for the fourth derivative. Jounce is the rate of change of jerk, over the time. But some call the 4th, 5th and 6th derivatives \"Snap, \"Crackle\" and \"Pop\" (as for the Rice Crispies , as for those interested in wavelets). \n \n \nThis story is summarized in Third Base at American Scientist, by Brian Hayes : ( printer-friendly version , 2001). \n \n\"When base 2 is too small and base 10 is too big, base 3 is just right. \" \nIt even recalls the following conjecture: \nMore than 20 years ago, Paul Erd\u00f6s and Ronald L. Graham published a conjecture about the ternary representation of powers of 2. They observed that 2^2 and 2^8 can be written in ternary without any 2s (the ternary numerals are 11 and 100111 respectively). But every other positive power of 2 seems to have at least one 2 in its ternary expansion; in other words, no other power of 2 is a simple sum of powers of 3. Ilan Vardi of the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes scientifiques has searched up to 2^6973568802 without finding a counterexample, but the conjecture remains open. \n \nYet, even-though the first attempts have met difficulties (check out the early 1950 High Speed Computing Devices in djvu ), people are still working towards ternary physical systems: Klein M., Mol J. A., Verduijn J., Levine R. D., et al. Ternary logic \nimplemented on a single dopant atom field effect silicon transistor. \nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS. 2010; 96(4) (see Raphael Levine ). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo yes Igor, this brick-like technology does (almost) exist . Or probably in a near future. Maybe it is not practical enough yet, or the world is not ready for that. A while ago (30 years), i learned how to count in binary with my fingers (thanks to a mormon American, CF, thinking of you), and we have three phalanges, so i can easily switch.

(attributed to Wilson Mizner) \n \n The most interesting example i had seen so far was a paper i reviewed on nonsubsampled contourlets (a kind of discretized, directional wavelet ). Its content had about 60% overlap with a more standard and authoritative paper on the topic. A big difference resided in the typeset: the text was written with word (instead of LaTeX), the figures were drawn in Word too (instead of Xfig, InkScape). I hereby provide a little excerpt, so you can check the subtle differences: \n \n \n Original paper: 2) Nonsubsampled Directional Filter Bank (NSDFB): The directional filter\n bank of Bamberger and Smith [ 18 ] is constructed by combining \ncritically-sampled two-channel fan filter banks and resampling \noperations. The result is a tree-structured filter bank that splits the \n2-D frequency plane into directional wedges. A shift-invariant \ndirectional expansion is obtained with a nonsubsampled DFB (NSDFB). The \nNSDFB is constructed by eliminating the downsamplers and upsamplers in \nthe DFB ( see also [20] ). This is done by switching off the \ndownsamplers/upsamplers in each two-channel filter bank in the DFB tree \nstructure and upsampling the filters accordingly. This results in a tree\n composed of two-channel NSFBs. Fig. 3 illustrates a four channel \ndecomposition. \n \n Submitted paper: b: Nonsubsampled Directional Filter Bank (NSDFB) The directional filter bank of Bamberger and Smith [ 14 ] is constructed by combining critically-sampled two-channel fan filter banks and resampling operations. The result is a tree-structured filter bank that splits the 2-D frequency plane into directional wedges. A shift-invariant directional expansion is obtained with a nonsubsampled DFB (NSDFB). The NSDFB is constructed by eliminating the downsamplers and upsamplers in the DFB. This is done by switching off the downsamplers/upsamplers in each two-channel filter bank in the DFB tree structure and upsampling the filters accordingly. This results in a tree composed of two-channel Nonsubsampled Filter Banks (NSFB). Fig. 3 illustrates a four channel decomposition. \n \nBut i am very unfair: the reference list was quite different. Interestingly, to the genuine honesty of the (submitting) authors, the partly copied paper EVEN cited the original paper: A. L. Cunha, J. Zhou, M. N. Do. The nonsubsampled contourlet transform: Theory, design, and applications . IEEE Trans. on Image processing, 2006, 15(10): 3089-3101. \n \nI am not sure this recent \"copy-paste-publish\" trend deserves as much praise as Jorge Luis Borges short story: Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote . The story narrates 20th century writer Pierre M\u00e9nard's efforts to truly re-create Cervantes' Don Quixote, beyond a mere translation, in the 17th century Spanish, sparking thoughts on authorship, imitation and appropriation (well, 60% of my words are similar here to the Wikipedia page ;) There are worse artifacts than copy indeed: \"Mirrors and fatherhood are abominable because they multiply it [human kind] and extend it.(Les miroirs et la copulation sont abominables car ils multiplient le nombre des hommes)\" (J. L. Borges). \n \nThe recent example did some genuine editing: the title is partly new (SOA is mainly expanded), acknowledgments have been deleted, and the references cut to item 21.

Stay tuned, but do not expect too much] Meanwhile, check out Simon Leys (aka Pierre Rickmans) \" Le studio de l'inutilit\u00e9 \" (or The Hall of uselessness ), with a special attention to Leys' talk on 8 Nov. 2005 at l'Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, with its nice quote to Flaubert: \"I have always tired to live in an ivory tower; but a tide of shit is beating at its walls, threatening to undermine it. \" \n \n \n \"Modeling is a life skill\" ( Solomon Garfunkel )  \n \n \n \n \n \n \"To be able to use maths at a certain level, it is necessary to learn it at the next level\" ( Alexandre Borovik ) \n \n \n \n \n On April 4h, 2012, a meeting held in IPH , Paris. Under the motto: How to fix our math education (Comment r\u00e9parer l\u2019enseignement des math\u00e9matiques ?) . The main incentive was Solomon GARFUNKEL ( COMAP Inc. , Boston) and David MUMFORD (Brown University) paper \"How to fix our math education\", New York Times, August 28th, 2011 . The paper was translated in french in Le Monde (14 septembre 2011) by Jean-Michel Kantor under the same title: Comment r\u00e9parer l\u2019enseignement des math\u00e9matiques ? . Motivated by some prominence of mathematics, and bad results of France in PISA benchmarks, the conference aimed at answering the following questions: \n \n does our education system answer the needs of newly opened areas in the scientific and technical realms? \n how do we can train citizens on the present century? \n \n \nTwo talks were given by Sol Garfunkel (What Mathematics Do Educated Citizens Need To Know?) and Alexandre Borovik (What do children learn when we teach them mathematics?), chaired and translated by Jean-Michel Kantor . \n \n \n \nBoth conferences were profound, lively, though provoking and entertaining, in a different style. Sol explained the motivations behind the NYT paper: the U.S. education was local to the extreme, with highly varying levels between states, counties, and even neighborhoods. Two great 4-letter sticker acronyms (NCLB: no child left behind , under G. Bush, and RTTT: race to the top , under B. Obama) have tried, and are trying, respectively, to change this local situation, by establishing nation-wide standards. The resulting goals reside in showing that mathematics are honestly (in the meaning of the honn\u00eate homme ) useful and in ensuring the availability, in the future, of mathematicians and scientists. Mathematics provide a greater ability to understand (or model) the world: \"Modeling is a life skill\" (SG). Sol reminded that cellphones and MRI are as much as engineering as maths. He also pointed out how operational research, computers, statistics used to belong to math departments, and have now grown into self-owned fields. He advocated the use of real-life examples graphs through mail delivery, Voronoi cells and bisectors via *** pizza delivery from Bengladesh call centers and rain falls in Colorado. Indeed, teachers tend to provide students with answers for questions they do not ask for. Looks like the following quote, inspired by Plotin, attributed to J. Lacan : \u00ab l\u2019amour est donner ce qu\u2019on n\u2019a pas \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un qui n\u2019en veut pas \u00bb. So students (and forthcoming adults) need an ability to estimate. Maths are a necessity for survival. \n \n \n \n Alexandre Borovik drove a useful comparison between rhythm-impaired people (because of a drunk and noisy music teacher) and people who could not understand maths. Both are survivors. He considers (following Heinrich Neuhaus \" the art of piano playing \") that learning is an accumulation of neurological damage, reaching a threshold level. Some of us as only survivors. In a sort of Pareto-law, he tells that 95% of the population has no ideas on how 95% of the everyday stuff works, as a follow-on to the division of labor (Adam Smith, Frederick W. Taylor). He suggests re-branding maths into a tool for personal development and spiritual enhancement. Like music, not a profession, but a personal life-style. Teachers should thus be bound to the Hippocratic oath : do not arm . Which other school (mathematics including computer science) teaches \"substitution of terms\", at work in simple Excel sheets that provoke bracket overload (or in French \"surcharge parenth\u00e9tique\") when three opening brackets and cell-depending operators confuse most people. Maths should be both interesting AND difficult, remember the \" Law of excessive learning of mathematics \": \"to be able to use maths at a certain level, it is necessary to learn it at the next level\". \n \n \n \nHe finally suggests teaching math bits at certain ages: maybe basic algebraic structures at 6-9 when kids are natural question-asking machines, leaving set-theoretic abstractions for teen-age, where sex hormones lead some appeal to pure idealities. \n \n \n \n Additional lectures: \n \n Sol Garfunkel 10 Improving education will require teamwork \n Algebra: In Simplest Terms - Mathematical Induction \n Alexandre Borovik: Book in progress: Shadows of the Truth: metamathematics of Elementary Mathematics (pdf) \n \n \n \n \n Why Should Anyone Study Mathematics , Timothy S.

In particular, we can take advantage of different representations to sparsely represent important features such as edges and texture independently and then use these estimates to derive an improved estimate.\n \nThe hyperbolet construction is further refined in: \nG.

You may just quote wikipedia : \n \nThis algorithm, including its recursive application, was invented around 1805 by Carl Friedrich Gauss, who used it to interpolate the trajectories of the asteroids Pallas and Juno, but his work was not widely recognized (being published only posthumously and in neo-Latin).[1][2] Gauss did not analyze the asymptotic computational time, however. Various limited forms were also rediscovered several times throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. \nor refer to Gauss and the history of the fast Fourier transform, by Michael T.

A downloadable copy can be found here . The FFT has profound applied connections with early oil industry: some say (though i am not able to provide an online reference yet) that FFT algorithms were known to oil industry years before Cooley and Tukey's (1965) , and they did not even bother patent it (because patents are a way to disclose, and sometimes secret is just simpler for protecting). Other early insights on connections between electrical engineering and geophysics are to be found in Oral-History with Enders Robinson who states two main problems, related to some (yet unknown) inverse problem equation: \n \n \n  \n Gauss primes \n \n \nThey followed the new group, but they were also very concerned with their own special problems. Their problem was 1)to collect data, then 2) produce a map of where to drill the oil well. \n \nSo what about an even stronger Gauss fact? Well, Gauss can beat Stalin , Poutin AND Medvedev .

Not proud :) Yet this dull (not in the Ramanujan sense ) sequence reminded me of two nice formula for the golden ratio (aka $\\phi$, or the divine proportion): one rational, one radical.

Thus, far from being transcendental . Surprisingly, $\\phi$ bears some kind of transcendence (in the religious sense) as it is, somehow, beyond the grasp of the human mind, meaning it cannot be approched easily in a \"rational\" way, i.e. worse that any other number, as stated in a theorem by Adolf Hurwitz (1856-1919).

As opposed to traditional fMRI signal analysis techniques, we do not impose any prior knowledge of the event timing. Instead, our basic assumption is that the activation pattern is a sequence of short and sparsely-distributed stimuli, as is the case in slow event-related fMRI. \n \nWe introduce new wavelet bases, termed ``activelets'', which sparsify the activity-related BOLD signal. These wavelets mimic the behavior of the differential operator underlying the hemodynamic system. To recover the sparse representation, we deploy a sparse-solution search algorithm. \n \nThe feasibility of the method is evaluated using both synthetic and experimental fMRI data. The importance of the activelet basis and the non-linear sparse recovery algorithm is demonstrated by comparison against classical B-spline wavelets and linear regularization, respectively. \n \nKeywords: \n \nBOLD fMRI; Hemodynamic response; Wavelet design; Sparsity; l1 minimization \n \n Resonance-Based Signal Decomposition: A New Sparsity-Enabled Signal Analysis Method (DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2010.10.018) \n \nIvan Selesnick \n \nAbstract: \n \nNumerous signals arising from physiological and physical processes, in addition to being non-stationary, are moreover a mixture of sustained oscillations and non-oscillatory transients that are difficult to disentangle by linear methods. Examples of such signals include speech, biomedical, and geophysical signals. Therefore, this paper describes a new nonlinear signal analysis method based on signal resonance, rather than on frequency or scale, as provided by the Fourier and wavelet transforms. This method expresses a signal as the sum of a \u2018high-resonance\u2019 and a \u2018low-resonance\u2019 component\u2014a high-resonance component being a signal consisting of multiple simultaneous sustained oscillations; a low-resonance component being a signal consisting of non-oscillatory transients of unspecified shape and duration.

Qualitative results illustrate the good behavior of the proposed algorithm whatever the signal dimension is. Moreover, a comparative study of X-EMD with classical mono- and multivariate methods is presented and shows its competitiveness. Besides, we show that X-EMD extends the filter bank properties enjoyed by monovariate EMD to the case of multivariate EMD.

The latter observation has \nnot prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between \nefficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions \nas well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones, \nproposed in the past decade, share an hybrid heritage highlighting the \nmultiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper \npresents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in \nmultiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit \nredundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its \ninvariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation, \nrotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet \nprocessing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries \nrequire specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse) \nrepresentation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric \ndecompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed \nsurfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of \npartially overlapping \"pictures\". We hope that this paper will contribute to \nthe appreciation and apprehension of a stream of current research directions in \nimage understanding. \n \nKeywords: \nReview; Multiscale; Geometric representations; Oriented decompositions; Scale-space; Wavelets; Atoms; Sparsity; Redundancy; Bases; Frames; Edges; Textures; Image processing; Haar wavelet; Non-Euclidean wavelets \n \n Bandlet Image Estimation with Model Selection (DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2011.01.013) \n \nCharles Dossal and St\u00e9phane Mallat and Erwan Le Pennec \n \nAbstract: \n \nTo estimate geometrically regular images in the white noise model and \nobtain an adaptive near asymptotic minimaxity result, we consider a model selection \nbased bandlet \nestimator.

Thereby non-uniform k-space trajectories, such as random or spiral trajectories, are becoming more and more important, because they are well suited to be used within the compressed-sensing (CS) acquisition framework. In this paper, we propose a new reconstruction technique for non-uniformly sub-Nyquist sampled k-space data. Several parts make up this technique, such as the non-uniform Fourier transform (NUFT), the discrete shearlet transform and a augmented Lagrangian based optimization algorithm. Because MRI images are real-valued, we introduce a new imaginary value suppressing prior, which attenuates imaginary components of MRI images during reconstruction, resulting in a better overall image quality. Further, a preconditioning based on the Voronoi cell size of each NUFT data point speeds up the conjugate gradient optimization used as part of the optimization algorithm. The resulting algorithm converges in a relatively small number of iterations and guarantees solutions that fully comply to the imposed constraints. The results show that the algorithm is applicable not only to sub-Nyquist sampled k-space reconstruction, but also to MR image fusion and/or resolution enhancement. \n \nKeywords: \nAugmented Lagrangian methods; MRI reconstruction; Non-uniform Fourier transform; Shearlet; Compressed sensing \n \n Matching Pursuit Shrinkage in Hilbert Spaces (DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2011.04.010) \n \nTieyong Zeng and Francois Malgouyres \n \nAbstract: \n \nIn this paper, we study a variant of the Matching Pursuit named Matching Pursuit Shrinkage. Similarly to the Matching Pursuit it seeks for an approximation of a datum living in a Hilbert space by a sparse linear expansion in a countable set of atoms. The difference with the usual Matching Pursuit is that, once an atom has been selected, we do not erase all the information along the direction of this atom. Doing so, we can evolve slowly along that direction. The goal is to attenuate the negative impact of bad atom selections. \n \nWe analyze the link between the shrinkage function used by the algorithm and the fact that the result belongs to $l^2$, $l^1$ and $l^0$ space. Experimental results are also reported to show the potential application of the proposed algorithm. \n \nKeywords: \nDictionary; Matching pursuit; Shrinkage; Sparse representation \n \n Non Separable Lifting Scheme with Adaptive Update Step for Still and Stereo Image Coding (DOI:10.1016/j.sigpro.2011.01.003) \n \nMounir Kaaniche and Amel Benazza-Benyahia and B\u00e9atrice Pesquet-Popescu and Jean-Christophe Pesquet \n \nAbstract: \n \nMany existing works related to lossy-to-lossless multiresolution image compression are based on the lifting concept. It is worth noting that a separable lifting scheme may not appear very efficient to cope with the 2D characteristics of edges which are neither horizontal nor vertical. In this paper, we propose to use 2D non-separable lifting schemes that still enable progressive reconstruction and exact decoding of images. Their relevant advantage is to yield a tractable optimization of all the involved decomposition operators. More precisely, we design the prediction operators by minimizing the variance of the detail coefficients. Concerning the update filters, we propose a new optimization criterion which aims at reducing the inherent aliasing artifacts. A theoretical analysis of the proposed method is conducted in terms of the adaptation criterion considered in the optimization of the update filter. Simulations carried out on still images and residual ones generated from stereo pairs show the benefits which can be drawn from the proposed optimization of the lifting operators. \n \nKeywords: \nLossless compression; Progressive reconstruction; Lifting schemes; Separable transforms; Non-separable transforms; Adaptive transforms; Multiresolution analysis; Wavelets; Stereo coding \n \n La vertu d'un LA (Laurent Duval)"], "link": "http://laurent-duval.blogspot.com/feeds/7964240685432053138/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://www.laurent-duval.eu/": 4, "http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://laurent-duval.blogspot.com/": 2, "http://www.sciencedirect.com/": 1, "http://lcd.free.fr/": 1, "http://dx.doi.org/": 11}, "blogtitle": "La vertu d'un LA The virtue of an A - A fortunate hive"}, {"content": ["William of Ockham \n [Updated 2011/06/19 for iTWIST 2012 workshop in Marseille, see at bottom] \n[Updated 2011/07/02 for a call of paper to Journal of Applied Mathematics on \"Preconditioning Techniques for Sparse Linear Systems\"] \n \nYou still have one day (deadline: 2011/06/19) to submit a paper to ACM Multimedia SRED 2011 : First International Workshop on Sparse Representation for Event Detection in Multimedia , from 28.

Sparse signal processing reveals significant reduction in the sampling rate and processing manipulations. Efficient algorithms have been developed for sparse signals for various applications; the algorithms developed seem to be application specific. It is the aim of this special issue to compare so many algorithms for these applications. The goal is a unified view of sparse signal processing by bringing together various fields.The key applications of sparse signal processing are sampling, coding, spectral estimation, array processing, component analysis, and multipath channel estimation.

Often only noisy data are available, and if the problem is ill posed, regularization methods have to be applied for the stable approximation of a solution. Influenced by the huge impact of sparse signal representations and the practical feasibility of advanced sparse recovery algorithms, the combination of sparse signal recovery and inverse problems emerged in the last decade as a new growing area. Currently, there exist a great variety of sparse recovery algorithms for inverse problems. These algorithms are successful formany applications and have lead to breakthroughs in many fields (e.g., MRI, tomography). However, the feasibility is usually limited to problems for which the data are complete and where the problem is of moderate dimension. For really large-scale problems or problems with incomplete data, these algorithms are not well suited or fail completely. In the context of signal recovery, generalized sampling theories were developed to tackle the problem of data incompleteness. One outstanding approach is the theory of compressed sensing. A major breakthrough was achieved when it was proven that it is possible to reconstruct a signal from very few measurements. A crucial condition for compressed sensing is the so-called restricted isometry property. Nowadays, this strong requirement has been relaxed in several ways, but so far all formulations of compressed sensing are in finite dimensions. Quite recently, first attempts of infinite dimensional formulations emerged. In this special issue, our focus is on stable and numerically feasible recovery algorithms and\u2013and this is one major question\u2013whether these technologies generalize to the solution of operator equations/inverse problems. Hence we invite authors to submit original research papers and review articles that provide the state of the art in this field and extend the known theory and contribute therefore to answer these questions. We are interested in articles that explore aspects of generalized sparse sampling, sparse recovery, and inverse problems.

To make better use of current and future high-performance computing, and to fully benefit from these massive amounts of data, we must discover, understand and exploit the available parallelism in machine learning. Simultaneously, we have to model data in an adequate manner while keeping the models as simple as possible, by making use of a sparse representation of the data or sparse modelling of the respective underlying problem. \n \nThis special issue follows the 2011 Symposium on \"Distributed Machine Learning and Sparse Representation with Massive Data Sets\" (DMMD 2011).

This reconstruction can be defined as adaptively finding a dictionary which best represents the signal on sample bases. Sparse representation establishes a more rigorous mathematical framework for studying high-dimensional data and ways to uncover the structures of the data, giving rise to a large repertoire of efficient algorithms. The sparse representation has just been applied to visual analysis for few years, while has shown its advantages in processing the visual information. Thus it will have a great potential in this field. \nSparse representation has wide applications in image/video processing, analysis, and understanding, such as denoising, deblurring, inpainting, compression, super-resolution, detection, classification, recognition, and retrieval. Many approaches based on sparse representation were proposed for these applications in the past years, and showed the promising results. This special issue aims to bring together the range of research efforts in sparse representation for image/video processing, analysis, and understanding. The goals of this special issue are threefold: (1) to introduce the advances of the theories on sparse representation; (2) to survey the progress of the applications of sparse representation in visual analysis; and (3) to discuss new sparse representation based technologies that will be potentially impactful in the image/video applications (primary results are needed). \n \nThe scope of this special issue is to cover all aspects that relate to sparse representation for visual analysis.

Dobre, Memorial University of Newfoundland; Jitendra K. Tugnait, Auburn University \nSubmission deadline: March 28, 2011 (apparently past, still on the \"Open Special Issues\" page, yet on the upcoming publications, due February 2012) ( CfP ) \n The sparse (undersampled) data constraint in the statistical signal processing is quite common for efficient computation and system time-invariance validity. Hence, the research about how to build reliable statistical measures and statistical tests using sparse data for different signal processing applications is still quite challenging nowadays. When the real-time efficiency or the unnoticeable processing delay is required with the help of the state-of-the-art microprocessors or DSP platforms, researchers are still making continual efforts to develop new robust statistical methodologies. Two crucial indicators, \u201cnumber-of-samples to number-ofparameters- to-be-estimated ratio\u201d (referred to as SPR) and \u201csystem performance versus signal-to-interferenceplus- noise ratio\u201d(referred to as SPSINR), can reflect both sparse data constraint and robustness. The objective is to seek new ideas and techniques to surmount the existing signal processing methods in terms of low SPR and superior SPSINR but still achieve good computational efficiency. In the signal processing research, reliable statistical measures such as statistical moments/cumulants, Lp-norms, mean-square-errors (MSE), Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), mutual information/entropy, divergence, etc. are always in pursuit, especially subject to the restriction on the limited data and/or the time variance of the underlying systems instead of the classical asymptotical analysis based on the infinite data set. This special issue will focus on all aspects of design, development, implementation, operation, and applications of robust measures and tests using sparse data for detection and estimation. \n \nWe invite original and unpublished research contributions in all areas relevant to signal processing in cooperative cognitive radio systems. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to: \n New robust measures or objective functions for detection and estimation using sparse data \n New robust statistical tests for detection and estimation using sparse data \n New theoretical and empirical analyses for detection and estimation using sparse data \n New results for explicit expressions of CRB or variance for detection and estimation using sparse data \n Reliable signal quality measures using sparse data \n General frameworks for evaluating various statistical measures/tests using sparse data \n Journal: Journal of Applied Mathematics \nSpecial issue: Special Issue on Preconditioning Techniques for Sparse Linear Systems \nEditors: Massimiliano Ferronato, Department of Mathematical Methods and Models for Scientific Applications, University of Padova, Padova, Italy; Edmond Chow, School of Computational Science and \nEngineering, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta; Kok Kwang Phoon, Department of Civil Engineering, National University of Singapore \n \nSubmission deadline: November 1, 2011 [2011/11/01] ( CfP Special Issue on Preconditioning Techniques for Sparse Linear Systems ) \n The accurate and efficient solution to sparse linear systems of equations, arising from the discretization of PDEs, often represents the main memory- and time-consuming tasks in a computer simulation. Direct methods are still widely used on the basis of their robustness and reliability. However, they generally scale poorly with the matrix size, especially on 3D problems. For large sparse systems, iterative methods based on Krylov subspaces are a most attractive option. Several Krylov subspace solvers have been developed during the 1970s through the 1990s, and they are generating a growing interest in many areas of engineering and scientific computing. Nonetheless, to become really competitive with direct solvers they need an appropriate preconditioning to achieve convergence in a reasonable number of iterations. \n \nIt is widely recognized that preconditioning is the key factor to increase the robustness and the computational efficiency of iterative methods. Unfortunately, theoretical results are few, and it is not rare that \u201cempirical\u201d algorithms work surprisingly well despite the lack of a rigorous foundation. The research on preconditioning has significantly grown over the last two decades and currently appears to be a much more active area than either direct or iterative solution methods. On one hand, this is due to the understanding that there are virtually no limits to the available options for obtaining a good preconditioner. On the other hand, it is also generally recognized that an optimal general-purpose preconditioner is unlikely to exist, so new research fields can be opened for improving the computational efficiency in the solution of any specific problem at hand on any specific computing environment. \n \nWe invite investigators to contribute original research articles as well as review articles on the development and the application of preconditioning techniques for the solution to sparse linear systems. Potential topics include, but are not limited to: \n Development and numerical testing of novel preconditioners \n Development and numerical testing of preconditioners for specific applications \n Improvement of existing general-purpose algebraic preconditioners \n Theoretical advances on the properties of existing general-purpose algebraic preconditioners \n Application of existing techniques to novel fields \n Additional conference events are found at the Compressive sensing meetings page or SIVA Conferences (not updated often enough these times).

Block-diagonal matrices $F$ are the simplest examples; wavelet transforms are more subtle. We show that every example can be factored into $A = F_1 \\dots F_N$ where $N$ is controlled by the bandwidths of $A$ and $A^{-1}$ (but not by their size, so this extends to infinite matrices and leads to new matrix groups). \n Banded matrices (or band matrices) are somewhat related to implementations of discrete wavelet transforms (see for instance Short Wavelets and Matrix Dilation Equations , 1995 by G. Strang and V. Strela). The 2010 PNAS sparked some interest as a means to implement fast local linear filters in both the forward and inverse transforms (an ascribed tandem , first anagram to banded matrices ), by splitting matrices into ones faster to compute. In Unraveling the Matrix (A new way of analyzing grids of numbers known as matrices could improve signal-processing applications and data-compression schemes) at MIT News, Larry Hardesty states that: \n In a paper published in the July 13 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, MIT math professor Gilbert Strang describes a new way to split certain types of matrices into simpler matrices. The result could have implications for software that processes video or audio data, for compression software that squeezes down digital files so that they take up less space, or even for systems that control mechanical devices. \n[...] \nRichard Brualdi, the emeritus UWF Beckwith Bascom Professor of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, points out that a mathematical conjecture that Strang presents in the paper has already been proven by three other groups of researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting theorem,\u201d says Brualdi. \u201cIt\u2019s already generated a couple of papers, and it\u2019ll probably generate some more.\u201d Brualdi points out that large data sets, such as those generated by gene sequencing, medical imaging, or weather monitoring, often yield matrices with regular structures. Bandedness is one type of structure, but there are others, and Brualdi expects other mathematicians to apply techniques like Strang\u2019s to other types of structured matrices. \u201cWhether or not those things will work, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Brualdi says. \u201cBut Gil\u2019s already said that he\u2019s going to look at a different structure in a future paper.\u201d \nThe chronicle can been read at Dr. Dobbs and here in pdf as well. And News I care mentioned it briefly in Fast signal transform with Banded matrix method . \n \n  The blog of a mandated scribe (on mixed banded matrices ) can be used as a note to self . I completely forgot to read that paper, which was openly available at the time. Thanks to an update at Gilbert Strang's pdf paper repository , a few related others are now shared in pdf: \n \n Fast transforms: Banded matrices with banded inverses , Proc. National Academy of Sciences 107 (#28) (2010) 12413-12416. \n Abstract above \n \n Banded Matrices with Banded Inverses and A = LPU , Proceedings Intl. Congress of Chinese Mathematicians: ICCM2010, to appear. \n If $A$ is a banded matrix with a banded inverse, then $A = BC = F_1 \\dots F_N$ is a product of block-diagonal matrices. We review this factorization, in which the $F_i$ are tridiagonal and $N$ is independent of the matrix size. For a permutation with bandwidth $w$, each $F_i$ exchanges disjoint pairs of neighbors and $N \n \n \n Groups of banded matrices with banded inverses , Proc. AMS, to appear (2011) \n A product $A = F_1 \\dots F_N$ of invertible block-diagonalmatrices will be bandedwith a banded inverse. We establish this factorization with the number $N$ controlled by the bandwidths w and not by the matrix size n: When A is an orthogonal matrix, or a permutation, or banded plus finite rank, the factors $F_i$ have $w = 1$ and generate that corresponding group. In the case of infinite matrices, conjectures remain open. \n \n Triangular factorizations: The algebra of elimination , submitted to SIAM Review (2011) \n Elimination with only the necessary row exchanges will produce the triangular factorization $A = LPU$, with the (unique) permutation $P$ in the middle. The entries in $L$ are reordered in comparison with the more familiar $A = PLU$ (where $P$ is not unique). Elimination with three other starting points 1, $n$ and $n$, $n$ and $n$, 1 produces three more factorizations of $A$, including the Wiener-Hopf form $UPL$ and Bruhat\u2019s $U_1 \\pi U_2$ with two upper triangular factors. \nAll these starting points are useless for doubly infinite matrices. The matrix has no first or last entry. When A is banded and invertible, we look for a new way to establish $A = LPU$. First we locate the pivot rows (and the main diagonal of $A$). $LPU$ connects to the classical factorization of matrix polynomials developed for the periodic (block Toeplitz) case when $A(i,j) = A(i+b;j+b)$. Only for anagram sake, these approaches may reanimate BDDCs ( balancing domain decomposition by constraints ), which may sound a macabre distend to acerbated minds walking on candidate berms . \n \nAdditional papers: \n Factoring Permutation Matrices Into a Product of Tridiagonal Matrices ( pdf ) Michael Daniel Samson, Martianus Frederic Ezerman (July 2010) \n Gilbert Strang posited that a permutation matrix of bandwidth $w$ can be written as a product of $N < 2w$ permutation matrices of bandwidth 1. A proof employing a greedy ``parallel bubblesort'' algorithm on the rows of the permutation matrix is detailed and further points of interest are elaborated. \n Factorization Of Banded Permutations ( pdf ), Greta Panova (July 2010) \n We prove a conjecture of Gilbert Strang stating that a banded permutation of bandwidth $w$ can be represented as a product of at most $2w-1$ permutations of bandwidth 1. Approximating the inverse of banded matrices by banded matrices with applications to probability and statistics ( pdf ), Peter J. Bickel, Marko Lindner (February 2010) \n In the first part of this paper we give an elementary proof of the fact that if an infinite matrix $A$, which is invertible as a bounded operator on $\\ell^2$, can be uniformly approximated by banded matrices then so can the inverse of $A$. We give explicit formulas for the banded approximations of $A^{-1}$ as well as bounds on their accuracy and speed of convergence in terms of their band-width. In the second part we apply these results to covariance matrices $\\Sigma$ of Gaussian processes and study mixing and beta mixing of processes in terms of properties of $\\Sigma$. Finally, we note some applications of our results to statistics. \nNew words learned by myself today: \n acerbated : embittered, resentful \n berm : (1) a narrow shelf, path, or ledge typically at the top or bottom of a slope; also : a mound or wall of earth or sand (2) the shoulder of a road \n distend : become wider, cause to expand as it by internal pressure, swell from or as if from internal pressure  La vertu d'un LA (Laurent Duval)"], "link": "http://laurent-duval.blogspot.com/feeds/4007058623810022403/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www-math.mit.edu/": 7, "http://www.physorg.com/": 2, "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/": 1, "http://www.pnas.org/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://laurent-duval.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://arxiv.org/": 6, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2, "http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/": 3, "http://web.mit.edu/": 1, "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/": 1, "http://www.urbandictionary.com/": 1, "http://newsicare.wordpress.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "La vertu d'un LA The virtue of an A - A fortunate hive"}, {"content": ["For french listening folks only: \" Math\u00e9matiques : quelle p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 pour le prestige fran\u00e7ais ? \" on France Culture today.
