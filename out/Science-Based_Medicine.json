At present such technology is in its infancy, but is giving us a glimpse of what it will become. \n Recently Vanderbilt University announced that its team at the Center for Intelligent Mechatronics has developed an exoskeleton that paraplegics can wear on their legs to allow them to sit, stand, and walk. This is essentially a mechanized orthotic that paraplegics can wear on their legs. The researchers describe it as a \u201cSegway with legs\u201d \u2013 referring to the computer technology that controls the exoskeleton, which responds to the user\u2019s movement. If the user leans forward, then the legs will walk. If they lean back, then they will sit. \n Like any technology, you can take either a glass half-full or half-empty view of this device. I will cover both \u2013 first the good. \n Their system has some advantages over previous systems. It is about half the weight, coming in at 27 pounds while other lower extremity exoskeletons weigh 45 pounds. The exoskeleton is also small enough to fit in a standard wheelchair while being worn, and can be put on and taken off by the user alone. As described above, this system also incorporates intelligent control technology. Users with partial paralysis can have their own movements augmented, while for those with complete plegia the exoskeleton can do all the work. \n The exoskeleton allows for a significant increase in independent mobility for the user. This can be significantly helpful in getting paraplegics mobile, which would be advantageous to overall health and reduce the risk of certain complications, like bed sores. \n Now for the limitations: The system does not allow for sufficient balance to be used without crutches. This means that users require significant upper body strength and control in order to walks with the legs. There is also a weight limit, so overweight paraplegics, those over 220 pounds, cannot use the device. In short, users need to be fairly physically fit. \n The technical specifications indicate that the onboard lithium polymer battery can last for about 1 hour of use between recharges. It does not indicate how long it takes to recharge, but I would guess several hours. It also indicates that the sound generated by the device is 55 dBA, with ambient noise being 38 dBA. \n If we consider the various components of these types of systems, it appears that the engineering is fairly solid. The devices are well-engineered, reasonably powerful (although this is still a limitation) and increasingly light and portable. Battery technology to power the device is a limiting factor (as it is will many applications). There is a great deal of research into building a better battery, as so many technologies depend on battery technology (like electric cars, for example). The powered exoskeleton is one more technology that will benefit from general improvements in battery technology. \n The computer control seems to be the most advanced aspect of this device. Computers themselves are light and powerful with little energy consumption, and the software to provide intelligent control is already fairly advanced. I\u2019m not sure how close this technology is to providing independent balance (without the need for crutches for stability). Balancing algorithms already exist, such as with the powered wheelchairs that can balance on one set of wheels and climb stairs. There are already robots that can balance and walk on two legs , but nothing small enough to function as an exoskeleton. \n There is also the question of now users will adapt to robotics, whether as an exoskeleton (orthotic) or as a replacement for lost limbs (prosthetic). So far the research here is very encouraging. Virtual reality testing indicates that the brain is highly plastic in this regard, and can potentially adapt to new parts so that they feel natural, as if they are part of the body. In other words, it appears to be theoretically possible to neurologically\u00a0close the loop on orthotics and prosthetics, so that they feel and function like a natural part of the body. \n One interesting aspect of this is user control of robotic devices. This exoskeleton uses muscle and movement control \u2013 it responds to the user\u2019s own movements. However, other researchers are working methods of more direct brain control. These approaches involve internal or external electrodes that read brain activity and software that can learn to translate the activity into the desired action. There is a learning curve for the user as well, but eventually the user and computer can learn to communicate and robotic limbs may be able to respond naturally to the desires of the user. \n Current use of powered limbs is highly limited, but there is a steady stream of incremental advances in every aspect of the devices. What I think we have now is mainly a glimpse of the future. \u00a0We are nowhere near the Bionic Man level of technology, but we are inching closer to the day when such devices will essentially restore function and mobility to the paralyzed."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/cyborg-therapeutics/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://news.vanderbilt.edu/": 1, "http://www.youtube.com/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 2, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.switched.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["I was asked to write an article for Slate , the on-line magazine, about Andrew Weil\u2019s selection as the keynote speaker for the 2012 AAFP annual scientific assembly. The science and health editor, Laura Helmuth, was initially enthusiastic about what I wrote, but eventually decided not to publish it. Here is the initial draft of my article. My comments follow. \n Original Draft of Article for Slate \n The American Academy of Family Physicians picked Andrew Weil to be the keynote speaker at its annual scientific assembly October 16-20 in Philadelphia. What were they thinking? That\u2019s like having an astrologer give the keynote speech at an astronomy meeting. \n The AAFP stands for the best in conventional medicine, for the standard of care as determined by physicians and scientists. Weil doesn\u2019t.\u00a0The AAFP stands for evidence-based medicine. Weil doesn\u2019t. \n Perhaps those who invited him didn\u2019t know he had made pronouncements like this: \n I would look elsewhere than conventional medicine for help if I contracted a severe viral disease like hepatitis or polio, or a metabolic disease like diabetes. I would not seek allopathic treatment for cancer, except for a few varieties, or for such chronic ailments as arthritis, asthma, hypertension (high blood pressure), multiple sclerosis, or for many other chronic diseases\u2026. \n In his article \u201cA Trip to Stonesville: Some Notes on Andrew Weil \u201d\u00a0Arnold Relman, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, shed some light on Weil\u2019s background and his thought processes. Weil earned an MD from Harvard, but instead of choosing a specialty and following the usual path into residency training he dropped out, experimented enthusiastically with a variety of psychedelic drugs, and lived on an Indian reservation to learn from a shaman.\u00a0 Then he re-invented himself as America\u2019s guru of integrative medicine, established a commercial and educational empire, wrote books, and appeared on the cover of Time . \n According to Relman, Weil accepts science, but only to a degree. He has openly promoted \u201cstoned thinking,\u201d alleging that thoughts experienced while under the influence of psychedelic drugs or in altered states of consciousness are as valid as, or more valid than, scientific evidence. He has been known to reject clear evidence from clinical trials when it conflicted with his beliefs. He considers reality to be ambivalent; he tolerates mutually antagonistic ideas. He frequently dismisses common sense and medical fact. He believes in miracles and in the ability of mind to cause and to cure disease. \n Weil has snowed a lot of people because he offers so much excellent science-based information and advice that is consistent with what other doctors say. But he promiscuously mixes that good advice with questionable advice in a way that makes it impossible for the average consumer to tell which is which. The textbook Consumer Health: A Guide to Intelligent Decisions characterizes Weil\u2019s advice as \u201ca mixture of sense and nonsense.\u201d The Quackwatch website lists Weil under \u201cnonrecommended sources of health advice.\u201d \n Some of Weil\u2019s advice is frankly dangerous. He encourages self-care and irresponsible trial-and-error experimentation. For example, he recommends that patients with rheumatoid arthritis avoid pharmaceuticals and experiment with a series of lifestyle changes, dietary manipulations, alternative treatments, and diet supplement products. \u00a0Patients who follow this advice risk joint deformities and disabilities that might have been prevented by taking disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) early in the course of their disease. It is irresponsible for a doctor to recommend that rheumatoid arthritis patients try unproven treatments like bee-sting therapy, feverfew, and homeopathy while avoiding any mention of the proven benefits of DMARDs. \n Weil is the public face of \u201cintegrative medicine,\u201d an unfortunate movement that tries to infiltrate medical practice with treatments that have not been adequately tested for safety and effectiveness and in some cases have even been tested and shown not to work. Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, has called integrative medicine \u201cthe new snake oil.\u201d Dr. Steven Novella, Yale neurologist and founder of the Science-Based Medicine blog, has said it is \u201cused to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate.\u201d Dr. Arnold Relman has said: \n There are not two kinds of medicine, one conventional and the other unconventional, that can be practiced jointly in a new kind of \u201cintegrative medicine.\u201d Nor\u2026 are there two kinds of thinking, or two ways to find out which treatments work and which do not. In the best kind of medical practice, all proposed treatments must be tested objectively. In the end, there will only be treatments that pass that test and those that do not, those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not. \n Dr. Mark Crislip put it more bluntly : \n If you integrate fantasy with reality, you do not instantiate reality. If you mix cow pie with apple pie, it does not make the cow pie taste better; it makes the apple pie worse. \n \u201cIntegrative medicine\u201d is a marketing term rather than a meaningful scientific discipline. Weil is a better marketer than doctor. He appeals to consumers who are suspicious of \u201cthe medical establishment\u201d and \u201cBig Pharma,\u201d or who have succumbed to the naturalistic fallacy (the idea that artificial drugs are bad and anything natural is good, a myth easily refuted by examples like strychnine). \n Weil has developed a thriving business selling vitamins and supplements. And he has run afoul of the FDA for making unsubstantiated claims for his products.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What he does is inconsistent with the position of the AAFP that: \n The decision to provide special dietary intervention or nutrient supplementation must be on an individual basis using the family physician\u2019s best judgment based on evidence of benefit as well as lack of harmful effects. \n The Medical Letter also discourages routine vitamin supplementation for the general population. After their unbiased panel of experts reviewed all the available evidence, they said: \n Supplements are necessary to assure adequate intake of folic acid in young women and possibly of vitamins D and B12 in the elderly. There is no convincing evidence that taking supplements of vitamin C prevents any disease except scurvy. Women should not take vitamin A supplements during pregnancy or after menopause. No one should take high dose beta carotene supplements. A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables may be safer than taking vitamin supplements. No biologically active substance taken for a long term can be assumed to be free of risk. \n Weil acknowledges that the best nutrition is obtained through diet but says it is essential to take supplements as insurance against gaps in the diet.\u00a0 His website features a \u201cVitamin Advisor\u201d questionnaire that formulates individual recommendations; its deficiencies have been exposed on Quackwatch .\u00a0 The word \u201cvitamin\u201d is used loosely, since most of the recommendations are for non-vitamin diet supplements. Rather than just an advisor, it\u2019s a marketing tool that puts the Weil brand of recommended supplements in a shopping cart. It recommended that my healthy 27-year-old daughter take a daily multivitamin, a daily antioxidant, a calcium/magnesium pill, evening primrose oil, milk thistle, omega 3, and 1000mg vitamin C, at a total monthly cost of\u00a0$99.90.\u00a0 No reputable medical authority would agree. I have reason to think she will remain just as physically healthy without those products, and she will definitely be financially healthier. \n As if that weren\u2019t enough, Weil has now embarked on a new endeavor: a collaboration with Innate Response Formulas to develop a system of \u201cSeasonal Therapeutics\u201d with seminars and a new line of products tailored to \u00a0the seasons: \n \n Autumn: Season of Harvest: focuses on liver and GI \n Winter: Season of Reflection: focuses on immune and mood \n Spring: Season of Renewal: focuses on purification and allergy \n Summer: Season of Vitality: focuses on cardio and joint health. \n \n The seminars promise to teach attendees how to: \n \n Use evidence-based, targeted nutritional supplementation to restore integrity to the gastrointestinal mucosa, enhance digestive function, repopulate the microbiome, and optimize immune function \n \u00a0Utilize seasonal changes in the diet to assist the body\u2019s detoxification mechanisms \n Integrate stress management strategies that encourage the exploration of gratitude and meditation \n \n This program claims to be evidence-based, but there is no scientific evidence that winter is the season of reflection, that the average person\u2019s gastrointestinal mucosa has lost integrity and needs to be restored, that digestion needs to be enhanced, that the body needs help with its detoxification mechanisms or that diet changes would assist it, that any regimen of supplements is capable of optimizing immune function, that training in exploring gratitude improves health, or that a seasonal approach to diet and supplements offers any health benefits. This is speculation, pseudoscience, imagination, and marketing genius, not science. \n The annual AAFP Scientific Assembly used to stand for the best in scientific medicine. It used to be a great opportunity for family physicians to learn about new developments, to review current standards of practice, and to brush up on their skills. By inviting Weil, the AAFP has descended to a new low and has sadly tarnished its reputation. I\u2019m a life member of the AAFP, but I won\u2019t be attending this meeting, and I have written a strong letter of protest to its organizers. We need good medicine based on good evidence; we don\u2019t need medicine based on speculation or \u201cstoned thinking.\u201d \n \n \u00a0 Other Protests \n I was not the only one to object. Back in August, Orac also criticized the AAFP for selecting Weil . \u00a0The Institute for Science in Medicine wrote a letter to the AAFP and received an answer with flimsy excuses \u00a0that Orac promptly demolished . Both letters are published on the ISM website.\u00a0Others, including the Dutch Society Against Quackery, wrote letters of protest. In online forums, many commenters from the US and other countries have expressed their astonishment that the AAFP was allowing him to speak. \n Editing Changes \n During the editing process, there were several deletions, additions, and questions raised. The editor deleted the quote from Relman about \u201cthere are not two kinds of medicine\u201d because she felt it was redundant. She changed my characterization of integrative medicine from \u201ctrying to infiltrate medical practice with treatments that have not been adequately tested\u201d to \u201ctreatments that in many cases have not been adequately tested.\u201d She suggested trimming Weil\u2019s statement about not seeking help from conventional medicine \u201csince he\u2019s saying that he would not use allopathy for the latter things, just the first few.\u201d(I really don\u2019t understand this. If anything, I suppose the comma placement in the quote might lead to confusion and to the misinterpretation that he would accept conventional treatment for chronic diseases along with \u201ca few varieties\u201d of cancer; but it is clear from his other writings that he wouldn\u2019t. He consistently recommends alternative treatments for all of those chronic diseases. My example of rheumatoid arthritis is a case in point). She asked for a stronger quote. She thought the point wasn\u2019t as strong as it could be\u00a0 \u201csince there aren\u2019t great treatments for some viral diseases.\u201d (Viruses were only one item on his long list, and there are effective evidence-based conventional treatments for many viral diseases, and alternative medicine has nothing better to offer.) \n She had 3 main areas of concern: \n \n She said the lawyers would want me to contact Weil for comment. I didn\u2019t see why this was necessary; but I complied, sending an e-mail to a publicity link on his website. I didn\u2019t get an answer, so we could legitimately say \u201cWeil could not be reached for comment.\u201d \n She said the lawyers would object to some of my statements so she made me tone down my language. For instance, I could not say some of Weil\u2019s advice was \u201cdangerous.\u201d (Even though I think I demonstrated that it was.) And she objected to my saying \u201cWeil doesn\u2019t\u201d in the second paragraph; I revised that and added 2 links to demonstrate that he doesn\u2019t. I was not allowed to say Weil was a better marketer than doctor. \n Her biggest concern: \u00a0I had not provided original sources for everything I said. \n \n Primary Sources \n I had relied on both primary and secondary sources. Mainly one secondary source; and that one, Arnold Relman, was a trustworthy one. I had also relied on having long ago read library copies of couple of Weil\u2019s books, on what I read on his website, and on my observation of his activities over many years. I was unable to provide links to primary sources for a few of my statements. \n \n I had taken Marcia Angell\u2019s \u201csnake oil\u201d quote from a secondary source but I was unable to verify it from the primary source, so I offered to substitute this : \n \n Marcia Angell, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, said \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s so amazing to me is the way a lot of proponents of alternative medicine will follow anything\u2026 Andy Weil says without any evidence whatsoever, faithfully on his word alone.\u201d \n \n She asked me to provide a link or an example for my statement that Weil has rejected evidence from clinical trials. I couldn\u2019t find a link but I provided an example where he rejected credible evidence against osteopathic manipulation for ear infections because he had \u201cseen it work.\u201d He describes that in one of his books, but I read it a long time ago and can\u2019t even remember which book. \n She wanted a link to Weil\u2019s own words showing that he believes in miracles and the ability of the mind to cure disease. I couldn\u2019t locate any specific links. Relman reported that after reading Weil\u2019s books, and the texts of his books are not available on the Internet. \n She made me delete the quotation from The Medical Letter simply because it is not available online without a subscription. (Since when are print sources not acceptable references? Most articles from journals like JAMA, NEJM, and Lancet aren\u2019t available online without a subscription either, except for abstracts on PubMed).\u00a0She asked for a link to another source questioning daily multivitamins, and I provided two of them. She did not want to use my quotation of the AAFP\u2019s position on multivitamins because she thought it was not strong enough to support my point. \n \n After considerable editorial back-and-forth, she announced that she couldn\u2019t run the story on Slate after all. It would need \u201ca lot more primary reporting of Weil\u2019s misdeeds\u201d and there was not enough time left before the AAFP meeting to seek those out (partly because she took so long to get around to editing my draft after I submitted it!). I thought I had enough primary sources to establish that he was guilty of misdeeds (his run-in with the FDA, his flawed Vitamin Advisor, his seasonal supplements, his recommendations for rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). And I considered Relman to be eminently reliable as a secondary source. \u00a0She said: \n I agree that the Relman article was a good one to reference, and it was a good idea to link to it and other articles. But we do want to provide readers with primary sources, at least for a story\u2019s strongest claims. I agree with your interpretation of the data, but in part for the sake of readers who don\u2019t agree or aren\u2019t convinced, it\u2019s best to provide the raw data (in this case, Weil\u2019s own words) so readers can judge for themselves. \n One problem with that is that readers are not good at judging for themselves. If they were, Weil could never have risen to such prominence. \n I\u2019m Not Cut Out for This \n I am not an investigative reporter but a doctor who comments on the news from a science-based medical perspective. The editor knew that when she originally approached me to write for Slate after reading my work on SBM and elsewhere. Before she rejected my Weil article she had accepted and published my article on acupuncture in the military. \u00a0The editing process for that article was relatively painless. She tightened and improved my text, and she even made it more forceful and controversial by giving it an inflammatory title and calling acupuncture \u201cquackery\u201d (I had deliberately avoided using that word but I let her persuade me to use it, which I now regret). \n This was my second foray into popular media after my painful experience with O, The Oprah Magazine . \u00a0I thought this time it was going to be better. I was disappointed. She did say she would be happy to run other stories by me in the future, but I don\u2019t know\u2026I don\u2019t need the money (a token $100 per article) and I \u00a0don\u2019t need the hassle. My writing on SBM is unpaid, and it doesn\u2019t reach as many readers; but it maintains my independence and integrity. Like Frank Sinatra ,\u00a0 I can be proud that \u201cI did it my way.\u201d"], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/andrew-weilaafp-article-rejected-by-slate/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.pbs.org/": 1, "http://www.slate.com/": 1, "http://scienceblogs.com/": 2, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.lyricsfreak.com/": 1, "http://www.scienceinmedicine.org/": 1, "http://www.drweil.com/": 1, "http://www.quackwatch.com/": 2, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 2, "http://www.fda.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["Editor\u2019s note: Because of Dr. Gorski\u2019s appearance at CSICon over the weekend, he will be taking this Monday off. Fortunately, Dr. Coyne will more than ably substitute. Enjoy! \n NIH is funding free training in the delivery of the Cancer to Health (C2H) intervention package, billed as \u201cthe first evidence-based behavioral intervention designed to patients newly diagnosed with cancer that is available for specialty training.\u201d The announcement for the training claims that C2H \u201cyielded robust and enduring gains, including reductions in patients\u2019 emotional distress, improvements in social support, treatment adherence (chemotherapy), health behaviors (diet, smoking), and symptoms and functional status, and reduced risk for cancer recurrence.\u201d Is this really an \u201cempirically supported treatment\u201d and does it reduce risk of cancer recurrence? \n Apparently the NIH peer review committee thought there was sufficient evidence fund this R25 training grant . Let\u2019s look at the level of evidence for this intervention, an exercise that will highlight some of the pseudoscience and heavy-handed professional politics in promoting psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) interventions. \n \nThe report of the single study (full article available here ) evaluating the efficacy of this intervention for physical health outcomes appeared in the American Cancer Society journal Cancer in in 2008. \u00a0An earlier report ( full article available here ) claimed to demonstrate the effects of the intervention on the \u201csecondary outcomes\u201d of mood, immune function, health behaviors, and adherence to cancer treatment and care. \n The abstract of the 2008 Cancer article described the group intervention as a set of strategies to \u201creduce stress, improve mood, alter health behaviors, and maintain adherence to cancer treatment and care.\u201d The abstract reported not only a reduced risk of cancer recurrence but proclaimed \u201cpsychological interventions as delivered and studied here can improve survival.\u201d If this intervention indeed improved survival, it is curious that the claim was not echoed in the advertisements for this training program. \n When the article first came out, I did a simple chi-square calculation on the raw recurrence and death events in a pair of 2\u00d72 cross tabulations of outcomes for intervention versus control group. No matter how I played with the data in figure 2, group differences nowhere near approached significance. Here is the online calculator and below are the data in Table 2 so that you can experiment for yourself (click to enlarge): \n \n \n \n My colleagues and I decided to take a close look at the reports on this trial and write a commentary to be submitted to Cancer . We took the position that claims about reducing risk of recurrence and extending the survival of breast cancer patients are medical claims that should be held to the same standards as claims about medications and medical devices improving health outcomes. \u00a0These standards include consistency between the abstract and findings reported in the results section of an article, pre-specification of one or two primary outcomes and follow up period, pre-specification of analytic plan, presentation of results in a way that allowed readers to evaluate the appropriateness of choice and interpretation of statistical tests. The latter would include transparent presentation of unadjusted primary outcomes in analyses for time by treatment interactions and avoidance of substitution of secondary and subgroup analyses. \n To help ensure the standards are met, most biomedical journals have embraced CONSORT as the standard for reporting results of both clinical trials and, more recently, for abstracts . Many journals also require publicly accessible preregistration of trials for the publishing of later results, i.e., that investigators declare ahead of time their intentions for sample sizes, outcomes, and analyses, before they run the first patient. These standards are enforced less consistency with psychosocial trials, and reregistration was not in place at the time this clinical trial was implemented in the mid-90s. However, by the time these papers were published in 2004 and 2008, it had already been established that not meeting the CONSORT reporting standards involved a high risk of bias and unreliability of results. And investigators do not need the coaxing of CONSORT standards for abstracts to presume that abstracts should accurately reflect the results reported in the rest of the article. \n When we submitted the commentary to Cancer , it was initially rejected, with the editor citing a standing policy of not accepting critical commentaries if authors refused to respond. We asked the editor to re-evaluate the policy and reconsider the rejection of our commentary. We argued that the policy was inconsistent with the growing acceptance of the necessity of post publication peer review. Essentially the policy allowed authors to suppress criticism of their work, regardless of the validity of criticism. Furthermore, our commentary presented not only a critique of the article, it called attention to a failure in editorial review that was worthy of note in itself. We therefore requested that we be allowed to expand our commentary substantially beyond the strict word limitations of correspondence about a particular study. After a meeting of the editorial board, the editor graciously accepted our requests. \n In the commentary , we pointed out that the trial did not report significant tests for unadjusted outcomes and gave no rationale for the particular follow up period of 11 years (7 to 13) in which progression or deaths were recorded. Investigators committing themselves to a particular observation period ahead of time prevents post hoc shrinking or extension of the observation period to get more favorable results based on a peeking at the data. Nonetheless, we could find no significant differences in the proportion of women experiencing recurrence or dying, despite claims of the investigators to the contrary. Furthermore, the difference in median time to recurrence, six months, or to death, was small, given the length of observation period. \n How were the investigators able to claim significant effects? By relying on dubious multivariate analyses with too high a ratio of covariates to events (recurrence or death). I\u2019ll leave much of the technical statistical arguments to the commentary, but basically, the investigators\u2019 approach had a high risk generating spurious effects. It\u2019s always reassuring when results for simple unadjusted primary outcomes in a randomized trial hold up after adjustments for possible confounds, although the rationale for undertaking control of any initial differences between groups is unclear because randomization is itself supposed to take care of any. When results are not obtained in simple unadjusted analyses, but then show up in multivariate analyses, the suspicion is that they are spurious, because results of multivariate analyses are often dependent on arbitrary decisions about which covariates to include and how to score them, decisions that can be made and revised based on peeking at the data. We should be particularly suspicious when, as is the case in this trial, too many covariates are entered as controls. \n We went on to critically examine the earlier study of psychosocial measures, adherence, and immune function. \n Andersen BL, Farrar WB, Golden-Kreutz DM, et al: Psychological, behavioral, and immune changes after a psychological intervention: A clinical trial. Journal of Clinical Oncology 22:3570-3580, 2004 \n The abstract of this article reported testing the hypothesis \u201cpsychological intervention can reduce emotional distress, improve health behaviors and dose-intensity, and enhance immune responses.\u201d The results presented in the abstract were uniformly positive in terms of effects on anxiety and improved dietary habits, smoking, and adherence, with no negative results mentioned. \n When we examined the actual methods section, we found at least nine measures of mood, eight measures of health behavior, four measures of adherence, and at least 15 measures of immune function were assessed. There was no independent way of determining which of these measures represented the primary outcome for each domain. With so many outcomes examined, there was high risk of obtaining apparent effects by chance. \n Turning to the actual results, only one of the 9 measures of mood was significant in time by treatment interactions. The intervention seemed to have a significant effect on dietary behavior (although it is unclear why the seemingly very different dietary behaviors were not analyzed) and smoking, but no effect on exercise. As is often the case with early breast cancer patients, rates of adherence to chemotherapy were too high to allow any differences between intervention and control group to emerge. In terms of immune function, results were not significant for CD3, CD4, CD8 counts cell counts, or six assays of natural killer cell lysis. If we compare this overall pattern of results to what was stated in the abstract, we see a gross confirmatory bias in the suppression of negative results and highlighting of positive ones. \n Subsequent papers from this project amplified the confirmatory bias of these two papers by declaring a reduced risk of recurrence and death from breast cancer for intervention participants and gains for all secondary outcomes.\u00a0 These papers also cast doubt on whether the 2004 paper disclosed all of the outcome measures that were assessed. One article stated that for the subgroup of patients with elevated Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scores, the intervention reduced depressive symptoms. This outcome is not even mentioned in earlier reports, but these subgroup analyses seem to imply that a reduction in depressive symptoms did not occur for the full sample. It is a reasonable inference that this null finding was suppressed in earlier reports. CES-D scores would seem to be the preferred primary measure of mood outcome for such studies. The CES-D has validated clinical cut points, and it is commonly believed that depression is the mood variable most strongly related to immune function. Another article referred to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), also an excellent candidate for a primary outcome in a study attempting to affect recurrence and survival via links between psychological variables and the immune system. \n Our close reading of the results reported in these two articles suggests that the intervention is inert with respect to mood and immune function, and has no effect on progression and survival. The intervention is hardly ready for dissemination into the community. The designation of this intervention in advertisements for the free training as \u201cthe first evidence-based behavioral intervention designed to patients newly diagnosed with cancer\u201d is premature and exaggerated. What could be meant by \u201cevidence based\u201d? Claims of \u201crobust and enduring gains\u201d in all categories of outcomes are simply wrong. \n My colleagues and I gave our now familiar argument that there was lack of evidence that any psychosocial intervention could reduce risk of recurrence and improve survival. There was also a lack of evidence for possible mechanisms by which such effects could conceivably be achieved. \n Cancer published our commentary without a response from the authors because they continued to refuse to provide one. Our commentary was instead accompanied by a response from Peter Kaufmann , MD. We wondered why the choice came down to Dr. Kaufmann and why he would accept the offer to reply to us. He had not written much about cancer, but he is Deputy Chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch of National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and at the time his commentary was written, he was President of the Society of Behavioral Medicine. \n The Cancer to Health (C2H) intervention package is based on the assumption that psychological variables have clinically significant effects on physical health via the immune system. Despite the lack of support for this idea with respect to cancer, the idea remains highly attractive and resistant to rejection because it lends prestige to psychosomatic and behavioral medicine. At the annual meeting of SBM at which Dr. Kaufmann became president, the keynote address was delivered by David Spiegel and basically involved debating in absentia skeptics and critics of the notion that psychosocial intervention could extend survival of cancer patients, including me. I complained to Dr. Kaufmann that if Spiegel wanted to debate me, I should have been invited to respond. Kaufmann indicated that I would get an invitation for keynote in the future to remedy this imbalance, but the occasion never materialized. \n Subtitling his commentary \u201cTo Light a Candle,\u201d Kaufmann conceded that my colleagues and I had raised valid criticisms about the design and interpretation of the C2H intervention trial. However, he took issue with our recommendation that clinical trials of this kind be suspended until putative mechanisms could be established by which psychological variables could influence survival. Quoting our statement that an adequately powered trial would require \u201chuge investments of time, money, and professional and patient resources,\u201d he nonetheless called for dropping a \u201cpreoccupation with mechanisms and secondary aims,\u201d and instead putting the resources to increasing the sample size and quality of an intervention trial. \n I remain puzzled by Kaufmann\u2019s argument. In the absence of specification of a mechanism by which psychological variables could have such an effect, was Kaufmann nonetheless suggesting that we needed a large trial to overcome the lack of power of the moderate sized C2H trial? \u00a0I cannot imagine a NIH administrator making a similar argument for a large scale study of an herbal product or coffee enemas or other intervention with a similar undocumented mechanism of influence. \n Barbara Andersen, the principal investigator on both the C2H trial and the grant for trained professionals in delivering the intervention, has never responded in print to our criticisms and charges that the trial does not affect progression or survival. However, she has complained to administrators of the institutions of a number of her critics and asked that they put a stop to behavior having negative ramifications for the field of behavioral research in cancer. She also campaigned unsuccessfully to get another critique of a work that we published retracted. \n It is unlikely that NIH showed favoritism in funding the training grant, relying instead on scores obtained in peer review. Reviewers must have been swayed by the consistent confirmatory bias in presentation of the results of C2H. However, there is a bias in NIH supported forums given to claims about psychosocial interventions affecting physical health outcomes. Andersen and those making similar claims regularly get invited to annual NIH sponsored symposia at professional meetings and reiterate the claims again and again. Apparently, there\u2019s no room for critics on such panels. \n The two papers presenting the outcomes of C2H have inaccurate abstracts and data analytic strategies that hide that they are basically null trials. In this respect they are not alone. Elsewhere I have documented that other psychosocial trials \u00a0[ 1, 2 ,] conducted by PNI investigators would be revealed to be null trials if time x treatment interactions were transparently reported for primary outcomes. Here is what to look for: \n \n Ignoring of negative results in main analyses of primary endpoints. \n Favor secondary analyses, subgroup analyses, and endpoints developed post hoc over negative findings for primary analyses. \n Positive spin to abstract, highlighting best of results obtained using these strategies. \n Negative findings presented as if positive in subsequent publications. \n \n \n \n \n PNI cancer researchers take a Texas sharpshooter approach to identifying positive effects for immunological variables. The apocryphal Texas sharpshooter drove drunk around Texas with his rifle and a can of red paint and shot up the sides of buildings. Afterwards, he would draw a bull\u2019s-eye with some of his hits in the center, creating the impression of an expert marksman who always hit his mark. PNI researchers similarly collect numerous PNI measures, not on the basis of their known association with cancer, but based on their ease of assessment.\u00a0 Measures derived from saliva samples are particularly popular. Investigators then declare whatever measures prove significant as evidence that they have tapped into the PNI of cancer. Further, they claim to replicate existing studies, when existing studies obtained significant effects with different measures. Any positive result obtained with a battery of measures is declared a replication, even when it is not a precise replication. \n Compared to cancer, behavioral interventions in HIV+/AIDS have the advantage of well validated mechanisms by which behavioral interventions might conceivably influence the immune system, and in turn, readily measurable assessments of any clinically significant impact. This area has attracted considerable interest from PNI researchers, who, similar to cancer PNI researchers, praise their own and each other\u2019s success in modifying clinically relevant immunological parameters. But a meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of 46 separate stress management interventions for HIV+ adults (N = 3,077) tells a different story\u201d \n To our surprise, we did not find evidence that stress reduction interventions improve immune functioning or hormonal mechanisms that could influence immunity. These findings contrast with the PNI perspective that guided our work and most of the interventions included in our review\u00a0 (Antoni, 2003; Robinson et al, 2000). Thus, even though chronic stressors are known to suppress both cellular and humoral markers (see Segerstrom & Miller, 2004) the short-term use of stress-management strategies does not seem to reverse these processes in patients with HIV. \n PNI cancer researchers remain a self-congratulatory group with a strong confirmatory bias in their mutual citations of the field\u2019s claimed successes. Judging by citation patterns in the incestuous journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity , one can readily get the impression that there are never any negative studies in the PNI cancer literature. \n The articles reporting results for the C2H trial continue to be highly cited, with little apparent effect of our criticism. \u00a0\u00a0With a lack of other positive trials that can be cited, particular importance in the PNI literature has been attached to the claims that C2H extend survival of cancer patients. There is apparently little concern about conveying unrealistic expectations to patients concerning effects of psychosocial intervention on their immune system, and these claims fit with patents\u2019 impressions and motivations for going to peer support groups and group therapy. \n Cancer patients sometimes faced difficult choices about medical interventions to manage their disease. It is unfortunate if they are provided with misinformation that all they need to do is get stress management interventions to slow progression and extend their survival. Belief that these interventions are effective can discourage them from committing themselves to more effective, but painful, fatiguing, and disfiguring medical interventions."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/nih-funds-training-in-behavioral-intervention-to-slow-progression-of-cancer/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"https://dl.dropbox.com/": 4, "http://graphpad.com/": 1, "http://cancertohealth.osu.edu/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/": 1, "http://www.fallacyfiles.org/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 12, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 2, "http://www.consort-statement.org/": 1, "http://projectreporter.nih.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["Preamble: When my book Bonesetting, Chiropractic, and Cultism [full text] was published in 1963, renouncing chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory and recommending that chiropractic be developed as a subspecialty of medicine in the treatment of mechanical-type back pain, the chiropractic profession refused to acknowledge or review the book.

He treats patients by adjusting misaligned vertebrae to \u201crelieve pressure on nerves and restore whole body wellness.\u201d \n Unfortunately, such advertisements are common and unchallenged, reflecting a theme typical of a pseudoscientific alternative healing method. \n I don\u2019t know of any reason to believe that adjusting a misaligned or \u201csubluxated\u201d vertebra to remove nerve interference will improve health or cure an organic ailment. If you follow the guidelines of science, the chiropractic vertebral subluxation theory appears to be a tenuous belief system, far removed from a legitimate theory based on accepted knowledge that can be studied or explained. When I was being taught subluxation theory in chiropractic college, the anatomy and physiology textbooks I studied led me to question subluxation theory. It quickly became apparent to me that the body\u2019s organs are innervated primarily by autonomic nerve ganglia and plexuses located outside the spinal column, supplied largely by autonomic cranial and sacral nerves that pass through solid bony openings and by preganglionic spinal cord fibers. The very important vagus nerves traverse openings in the base of the skull and travel down to supply thoracic and abdominal organs. Overlapping autonomic nerve supply from many directions and sources, along with chemical, hormonal, and circulatory factors, assures function of the body\u2019s organs, unaffected by a segmental dysfunction (subluxation) and independent of spinal nerves that are designed primarily to supply musculoskeletal structures. Spinal nerves are commonly compressed by disc herniation and osteophyte formation, affecting the peripheral and musculoskeletal structures they supply, but such \u201cpinched nerves\u201d have never been associated with ill health or organic disease. \n Despite increasing educational requirements for enrollment in a chiropractic college and inclusion of adjunctive treatment methods in chiropractic care, the basic principles of chiropractic have not changed much, persisting largely because of their simplicity in attracting and educating patients. Locating a \u201csubluxation\u201d in the spine and then pointing to a nerve chart linking the subluxation to an organ or a disease process rarely fails to impress a prospective patient. Adjusting the spine to produce a pop that signals correction of an alleged subluxation, or simply telling the patient that a subluxation has been corrected, is a powerful form of suggestion that produces a placebo effect. \n Clinging to the theory that gave the chiropractic profession birth and independence, chiropractic associations and state laws continue to define chiropractic as a method of adjusting vertebral subluxations to restore and maintain health, guided by a modified version of vertebral subluxation theory (\u201cvertebral subluxation complex\u201d) to justify a broad scope of practice. A 2010 publication of the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE), Practice Analysis of Chiropractic , states that \u201cThe specific focus of chiropractic practice is known as the chiropractic subluxation or joint dysfunction . A subluxation is a health concern that manifests in the skeletal joints, and, through complex anatomical and physiologic relationships, affects the nervous system and may lead to reduced function, disability, or illness.\u201d This definition of chiropractic is in keeping with a paradigm formulated by the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) in 1996, signed by 16 North American chiropractic college presidents: \u201cChiropractic is concerned with the preservation and restoration of health, and focuses particular attention on the subluxation.\u201d \n Such subluxations have never been proven to exist. A review of web sites and advertisements sponsored by recent graduates of chiropractic colleges, however, reveals that subluxation-based chiropractic care is still very much in vogue. A 2011 study reported that \u201cDespite the controversies and paucity of evidence the term subluxation is still found often within the chiropractic curricula of most North American chiropractic programs.\u201d (Mirtz & Perle. The prevalence of the term subluxation in North American English-Language Doctor of Chiropractic programs. Chiropractic and Manual Therapies . 2011;19:14) \n Many students enrolling in chiropractic colleges today have undergraduate degrees. How can a chiropractor with a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree in science subscribe to what appears to be a scientifically indefensible subluxation theory? \n Critical Thinking vs. Pseudoscience \n Many people with a good education profess support for views based on a belief system, especially in the areas of healing and religion. I suspect that some advocates of pseudoscience are not capable of critical thinking and are simply products of the most persuasive voice they hear. An inherent ability to reason and think independently may be more important than an academic degree in the makeup of a science-based skeptic. In my own profession as a chiropractor, I was often amazed to see chiropractors with advanced academic degrees touting vertebral subluxation theory. While some of these practitioners were undoubtedly marketing a belief system for economic reasons, fully aware of the impropriety of their actions, it appeared to me that some of them were well-meaning but misinformed or simply did not understand what they had been taught. \n In 1998, the year of my retirement, the January issue of the American Medical Association\u2019s Archives of Family Medicine published my article, \u201cFinding a Good Chiropractor,\u201d designed to help family physicians distinguish between the good and the bad in the use of manipulation by chiropractors. My book Inside Chiropractic, A Patient\u2019s Guide , was published by Prometheus Books in 1999. I explained why I thought the chiropractic subluxation theory was false. I supported use of generic spinal manipulation as a modality in the treatment of some types of back pain. Unlike homeopathy and some other dubious healing methods that have no value whatsoever beyond a placebo effect, spinal manipulation as a form of manual therapy has some plausible basis for relieving back pain and restoring mobility. \n Speaking Out Against Nonsense \n I wrote many articles critical of chiropractic and subluxation theory. The biggest splash of all came when the April 2001 online edition of Medscape General Medicine published my article \u201cIs the Chiropractic Subluxation Theory a Threat to Public Health?\u201d previously published in the winter 2001 issue of Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. I was inundated with hate mail. A spokesperson for the American Chiropractic Association described my article as \u201coutdated and inaccurate\u201d and asked Medscape to remove the article from their website. In September of 2005, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research , a leading peer-reviewed journal for orthopedic surgeons, published my article \u201cChiropractic: History and Overview of Theories and Methods,\u201d a review that took a critical look at chiropractic based on subluxation theory. \n Apparently reflecting the views of the majority, chiropractic associations have not renounced subluxation theory. Failure of the chiropractic profession to make the changes needed in the curriculum of chiropractic colleges to define the practice of chiropractic as a properly-limited specialty has kept the profession marginalized and mired in pseudoscience. Development of chiropractic as a physical-treatment method sans subluxation theory would lead to appropriate legal definitions of chiropractic. But the simplicity of chiropractic subluxation theory and its public appeal may make it difficult to change state laws in order to eliminate judiciary support for \u201cadjusting vertebral subluxations to restore and maintain health.\u201d If subluxation theory is not rejected by a chiropractic majority that is supported by public opinion, subluxation-based chiropractic will be perpetuated along with homeopathy, acupuncture, naturopathy, naprapathy, and other questionable but legally licensed alternative healing methods. \n (Three states allow licensing of an MD or a DO as a homeopathic physician, but many states allow licensed health-care providers such as chiropractors and naturopaths to use homeopathic remedies. Forty-four states and the District of Columbia license practitioners of acupuncture and oriental medicine, all of which is considered to be within the scope of practice of most health-care providers, especially chiropractors. Naturopathic physicians are licensed in 16 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Naprapathy, founded in the early 1900s by a chiropractor, advocates manipulation of joints and muscles to correct problems alleged to be caused by connective tissue disorders. Naprapathic physicians are licensed only in Illinois and New Mexico. There appears to be no shortage of practitioners who practice \u201calternative medicine,\u201d which seems to be gaining public acceptance under the label of \u201ccomplementary\u201d or \u201cintegrative\u201d medicine, reflecting public demand for nonsensical care along with conventional medical care.) \n It has been estimated that \u201cChiropractors perform about 90 percent of manipulation in the United States\u201d ( The Appropriateness of Manipulation and Mobilization of the Cervical Spine , RAND, 1996). With the public equating use of manipulation with chiropractic care, manipulation in general has been stigmatized by its association with chiropractic subluxation theory. Increasing use of spinal manipulation by physical therapists and orthopedic manual therapists, however, offers opportunity to bypass questionable chiropractic care when seeking appropriate treatment with spinal manipulation. Credible research, most often conducted by physical therapists, offers support for use of manipulation as part of the treatment armamentarium of physical medicine. \n Critics of chiropractic should take care not to include appropriate use of generic spinal manipulation in their criticism of chiropractic manipulation based on subluxation theory. As I have said many times, manipulation used to relieve pain and restore mobility is not the same as a chiropractic adjustment used to \u201crestore and maintain health.\u201d An asymptomatic and undetectable chiropractic subluxation alleged to affect general health is not the same as an orthopedic subluxation, a partial dislocation that can cause musculoskeletal symptoms. Generic spinal manipulation as a form of manual therapy (and the word \u201csubluxation\u201d) existed long before the development of chiropractic in 1895. Hippocrates, in describing methods of reducing \u201cdislocations\u201d in the spine ( On the Articulations ), noted that \u201cluxations and subluxations take place in different degrees.\u201d \n Choosing between Chiropractic School and Physical Therapy School \n While there are undoubtedly some chiropractors who use spinal manipulation appropriately and do a good job treating mechanical-type neck and back pain, I would not recommend that anyone enroll in a chiropractic school where there might be indoctrination in a belief system that is rejected by the scientific community and shaded by societal suspicion. Some chiropractic colleges are less subluxation-centered than others but may embrace controversial alternative healing methods. A properly limited chiropractor who might be a graduate of one of the better chiropractic schools, and who is aware of his or her limitations, would be forced to endure the nonsense and the competition of licensed unscientific alternative healers and subluxation-based chiropractors who set the standards, ostracizing nonbelievers and alienating the cooperation of mainstream health-care professionals. \n Persons interested in studying manipulative therapy would be best served by going for a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree that would allow interaction with the scientific community in researching and performing manual therapy without the stigma associated with chiropractic. At the present time, 47 states and the District of Columbia permit direct access to services provided by physical therapists, allowing private practice that fits in with mainstream health care. \n All things considered, with the status and the future of chiropractic in doubt, I would not think that any well informed person following the guidelines of science today would choose to be a Doctor of Chiropractic rather than a Doctor of Physical Therapy. \n When confronted with two courses of action I jot down on a piece of paper all the arguments in favor of each one\u2500then on the opposite aside I write all the arguments against each one. Then by weighing the arguments pro and con and canceling them out, one against the other, I take the course indicated by what remains. \n \u2500 Benjamin Franklin, circa 1732 \n \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \n \n \nSamuel Homola is a retired chiropractor whose practice was limited to care of back pain and related musculoskeletal problems.

Growing costs from their use. Physicians deemed \u201cDupes of Big Pharma\u201d for their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. A call to produce better information on which drugs work best. Finally, shoddy drug manufacturing is injuring and even killing patients. These stories could be lifted from today\u2019s headlines \u2014 but they\u2019re actually from 1962 . Problems with the behavior of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, and our relationship with it, are not new. Nor are they restricted to one country. Every developed country\u2019s health-care system is different, but one feature is near-universal: none have a public pharmaceutical industry. Ever nation relies on for-profit, private companies to supply its population with drug products. \n Blog posts here can get pretty wonkish about health policy, as many of the substantial challenges to science-based medicine have their roots in regulation \u2014 whether it\u2019s DSHEA which implemented a regulatory double-standard for supplements, or the state-by-state legislative alchemy that Jann Bellamy has documented, which transforms magical thinking and pseudoscientific practices into registered and regulated health practitioners. Federal food and drug regulations have also come under some scrutiny ( and praise ). The FDA\u2019s under fire again; this time over its responsibility to oversee pharmaceutical manufacturing. But in this case, it\u2019s not Big Pharma that\u2019s the villan \u2014 it\u2019s pharmacies. \n Pharmacies rarely makes the headlines, and that\u2019s probably a good thing. Safe and effective is boring. But my Google Alert for pharmacy news has been pinging me nonstop. The catastrophe of fungal meningitis that continues to emerge across America may be the worst drug manufacturing disaster since the 1930\u2032s when the S.E. Massengill company inadvertently mixed the antibiotic sulfanilamide with antifreeze , killing over 100 people. It was the Massengill fatalities that led to the Food, Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1938). They were a good first start, focusing on the requirement to for manufacturers to document that their products were safe. But they didn\u2019t go far enough. \n From today\u2019s perspective, the FD&C Act (1938) was pretty basic.\u00a0 There was no requirement for manufacturers to demonstrate good manufacturing practices. And if the FDA didn\u2019t move to block a sale within 60 days, a product could be sold. By the 1950\u2032s, it was clear that the Act wasn\u2019t fully effective. Concerns of excessive pricing and questionable evidence statements from manufacturers eventually led to hearings led by Senator Estes Kefauver . Over 18 months an array of new amendments emerged: efficacy claims would be reviewed and approved. Side effects must be reported. Drugs must be approved for sale before any sales could begin. Good drug manufacturing standards would be mandatory, and would be FDA-inspected. Advertising would be monitored. Drugs would have clear generic names, in addition to trade names. All of these proposals made it into the final wording. What\u2019s pretty interesting is what they cut: \n \n Compulsory licensing of generics after 3 years to allow competitive markets \n Banning so-called \u201cme-too\u201d drugs \u2014 new drugs which failed to offer substantial improvements over existing drugs \u2014 would be forbidden, as well as minor modifications to existing chemicals that didn\u2019t offer any therapeutic improvements (hello, Nexium) \n Patent approval only where a new drug offered advantages over the current standard treatment \u2014 not just demonstrating superiority over placebo \n \n Why did they get cut? As expected, there was strong opposition from pharmaceutical companies. But the American Medical Association also objected, particularly against a greater role for the FDA in evaluating efficacy. The bill was on life support until the thalidomide disaster in 1962 that secured its passage, now called the Kefauver-Harris Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act . It effectively set the template for modern-day regulation which has been subsequently emulated around the world. Without these amendments, the requirements for pre-licensing clinical trials probably would not exist. Nor would longer patents, granted in 1984 based on appeals for longer patent protection due to the barriers established before drugs can be sold. \n So how did we end up with a meningitis outbreak this year? Through a loophole in the Act. The contamination of injectable steroids is one of a long string of medical harms caused by \u201ccompounding pharmacies\u201d \u2014 pharmacies that skirt FDA regulations by acting as chameleons. To hospitals and physicians, they\u2019re businesses selling drug products, just like any other pharmaceutical company. But to the FDA, they claim to be pharmacies, not pharmaceutical companies, which put them under the jurisdiction of state pharmacy regulators. Why the loophole? Until fairly recently, all pharmacies used to be compounding pharmacies . Each store made its own dosage forms like creams and capsules. Everything could be personalized. Today, compounding in the pharmacy has dwindled for most products, as Pharma can do it faster, cheaper, and more accurately.\u00a0 But compounding is a legitimate part of pharmacy practice, and can fill real patient care needs. And in an era of regular drug shortages , they can manufacture drug product \u2013 but without any of the quality standards mandatory for pharmaceutical companies.\u00a0 Unlike federal requirements which are uniform across the USA and around the world , regulations for pharmacies are determined at the state level, by pharmacy regulators. The same degree of oversight simply does not exist. \n It should not be surprising that compounding pharmacies have fought all attempts by the FDA to impose more rigorous manufacturing standards, which would make it harder to sell products. To lawmakers, advocates position it as an access and \u201cright to choose\u201d argument especially for \u201cnatural\u201d products like \u201cbioidentical\u201d hormones which are often made by compounding pharmacies. These are the same pharmacies preparing chelation infusions , and they used autistic children to argue for their right to continue to manufacture these products, despite the fact that they are clinically useless for autism. But they seem to work well as a lobbying tool. They\u2019ve successfully killed legislation proposed in 1997, 2003 and again in 2007.\u00a0 This lobbying success is remarkable given there have been no shortage of problems: Since 1990 the Institute for Safe Medication Practice has documented 22 significant pharmacy compounding errors involving 71 different drugs resulting in over 200 adverse events \u2014 some fatal. \n But is FDA oversight required to keep fungal contamination out of injectable drugs? It shouldn\u2019t be. The United States Pharmacopeia Chapter <797> establishes sterile manufacturing standards which are expected to be adhered to by pharmacies that make these products. Tightening of requirements <797> in 2008 had the effect of causing more outsourcing to larger pharmacies, as smaller centres could not meet the requirements.\u00a0 Probably most concerning is that the requirement to follow <797> isn\u2019t uniform across states \u2014 five boards don\u2019t mandate it, and the others don\u2019t audit consistently. That seems to be the case in Massachusetts , where the New England Compounding Center (NECC),\u00a0 has now been closed permanently as it\u2019s revealed that\u00a0 basic safety and manufacturing standards, including <797> requirements were not being followed when it manufactured preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. The two lots of drug contaminated with black mold have reached 14,000 patients in 23 states. This is no small operation. Furthermore, NECC was flouting state pharmacy law by failing to act as a pharmacy: it shipped product out without a prescription, or labelled for an individual patient. \n Conclusion \n Regulatory frameworks evolve over time. Regrettably, it sometimes takes a public health catastrophe to give lawmakers the motivation to ignore vested interests and act in the interest of public health. Like the Massengil deaths in the 1930\u2032s, and the thalidomide birth defects in the 1960\u2032s, the New England Compounding Centre may prove to be the impetus for the appropriate regulation of compounding pharmacies. Products manufactured by facilities like NECC should receive the same regulatory oversight, and meet the same manufacturing standards as any other bulk manufactured drug product. What\u2019s clear is that this responsibility cannot be left to the pharmacy profession to manage itself.

The study is small and preliminary, but the results are interesting and do raise important questions about placebo responses. \n Researchers are increasingly trying to tease apart the various components of \u201cthe placebo effect.\u201d In reality we should use the term \u201cplacebo effects\u201d as it is demonstrably multifactorial. \u201cThe placebo effect\u201d really refers to whatever is measured in the placebo arm of a clinical trial \u2013 everything other than a physiological response to an active intervention. Within that measured response there are many potential factors that would cause an outcome from a fake treatment to be different from no treatment at all. These include statistical effects like regression to the mean and the natural course of symptoms and illness, reporting bias on the part of the subject, and a non-specific response to the therapeutic interaction with the practitioner. \n It is also critical to realize that placebo responses vary greatly depending on the disease or symptom that is being treated and the outcome that is being measured. Placebo response is greatest for subjective symptoms of conditions that are known to be modified by things like mood and attention, while it is virtually non-existent for objective outcomes in pathological conditions. So there is a substantial placebo response for pain and nausea, but nothing significant for cancer survival. \n In the current study researchers performed a retrospective analysis of an existing study population in which there was a no-treatment arm (waitlist control), placebo acupuncture with minimal practitioner interaction, and placebo acupuncture with enhanced emotional support (the \u201cwarm and fuzzy\u201d arm). The study population are those with IBS, a syndrome known to have a substantial emotional component. Further, the outcome was the subjective report of symptoms from the subjects. In other words \u2013 the syndrome and outcomes were amenable to maximal placebo responses. Prior studies have consistently shown that for subjective symptoms such as this the interaction with the practitioner is the single most important factor in reporting a subjective improvement in symptoms from a placebo intervention. \n In this study subjects were also genetically typed for the COMT gene \u2013 an enzyme that breaks down dopamine. The met variant of this gene is associated with decreased activity of the gene, and therefore greater availability of dopamine. The authors report: \n The methionine isoform has reduced thermostability, resulting in a three to four-fold decrease in activity relative to the ancestral valine isoform. This functional polymorphism has been correlated with variations in memory function, cognition, attentional processing, affect, confirmation bias, pain processing and sensitivity. \n They found: \n In this study, we demonstrated that IBS patients homozygous for the COMT val158met methionine allele (met/met) were the most responsive to placebo treatment. Heterozygous (val/met) patients showed an intermediate response, and homozygous valine (val/val) patients showed essentially no placebo mediated symptom improvement. \n Patients with the gene variant associated with increased dopamine activity in both alleles (copies of the gene) showed more of a placebo response, especially to the warm and fuzzy intervention. While again I have to emphasize the preliminary nature of this research, the results are plausible and do make sense. IBS is particularly susceptible to suggestion and a warm interaction with a practitioner, interventions that reduce anxiety and improve mood. Anxiety, mood, and the emotional response to pain and discomfort are all brain phenomena, and dopamine is an important brain neurotransmitter involved with emotion and reward, so it\u2019s not surprising. \n Assuming this result is reproducible, what are the implications of this finding? First, 20 out of 104 subjects had the met/met genotype \u2013 \u00a0the type that responded to placebo interventions. That means for about one fifth of the population placebo responses for subjective symptoms, especially those modifiable by anxiety and mood, are likely to be significant. About 52% had an intermediate response, and another 28% had essentially no response. This fits the typical overall 30% placebo response for subjective symptoms seen in clinical trials. \n There isn\u2019t much of a downside to being caring and supportive to patients (other than the time investment) and this can enhance the patient\u2019s sense of well-being, reduce anxiety, encourage compliance with treatment and good lifestyle choices, etc. But the effect size is perhaps only significant for a minority of patients, around 20%. \n It is also unclear if this result will extrapolate to other conditions. Perhaps dopamine activity is particularly important for gastrointestinal symptoms. It remains to be seen for how many other conditions the met polymorphism will be predictive of placebo response. \n None of this implies that placebo responses involve a real biological \u201chealing\u201d mechanism. We are still dealing with the reporting of subjective outcomes. Dopamine may even predict bias in reporting symptoms rather than what the patient experiences (similar to the association with confirmation bias found previously). We may be seeing a suggestibility effect more than anything else. \n This research also brings up another interesting possibility \u2013 screening out placebo responders from clinical trials. The pharmaceutical industry in particular has been interested in the idea of finding some way to eliminate likely placebo responders from \u00a0clinical trials so that the effect of the intervention (medication) would be easier to detect statistically. This could result in smaller and less expensive trials, or even detecting a positive effect that would have been obscured by placebo responders. \n This study therefore raises the possibility of having a met/met genotype for the COMT gene (or other genetic typing) be an exclusionary criteria for a clinical trial. Will this increase or decrease the reliability of the study findings and its applicability to the general population? \n It also raises the possibility of targeting specific therapies at those with the met/met genotype or other identified types that predict placebo responses. This kind of information could play a role in personalized medicine \u2013 targeting therapies to individual patients based upon their genetic makeup. We may be seeing a gene variant that predicts response (or lack of response) \u00a0to certain kinds of psychological interventions. I wonder if such gene variants would predict response to cognitive behavioral therapy for certain conditions. \n This is a good study in that it raises more questions than answers."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-placebo-gene/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.plosone.org/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["In 2011, chiropractor J.C. Smith published The Medical War Against Chiropractors: The Untold Story from Persecution to Vindication. He promises an expos\u00e9 comparable to Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s expos\u00e9 of slavery in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. His thesis is that the AMA waged a shameless attack on competition, motivated only by money. I think the reality is closer to what he quoted from Dr. Thomas Ballantine, Harvard Medical School: \n The confrontation between medicine and chiropractic is not a struggle between two professions. Rather it is more in the nature of an effort by an informed group of individuals to protect the public from fraudulent health claims and practices. \n The book is self-published, long-winded, repetitive, and flawed. It is a vicious screed crammed with bias, half-truths, insulting language, and innumerable references to Nazis and racial prejudice. In my opinion, Smith not only fails to make his case but degrades chiropractic. \n \n Practicing Medicine without a License \n Before chiropractic licensure was approved, many chiropractors were jailed for practicing medicine without a license.\u00a0 Smith thinks this was a bogus charge because they never used drugs or surgery. (He\u2019s wrong: practicing medicine is not defined as using drugs or surgery, but as diagnosing and treating any human disease, pain, injury, deformity, or physical condition. They were clearly breaking the law.) Chiropractors were forced to hide like Anne Frank or like slaves on the Underground Railroad. The Juice Man squeezed them for protection money; if they couldn\u2019t pay, his thugs beat them up. \n The AMA \n The AMA did some very regrettable things. They used inappropriate language, referring to chiropractors as rabid dogs. They attacked chiropractors as killers without any supporting evidence. Their intent was to destroy chiropractic. They tried to conceal what they were doing. Their biggest mistake was to prohibit MDs from associating with chiropractors. \n The Code of Ethics stated: \n A physician should practice a method of healing founded on scientific bases; and he should not voluntarily associate professionally with anyone who violates this principle. \n According to Smith, this expanded to prohibit a physician from belonging to any club, church, or organization if a chiropractor was also a member. If this is true, it is inexcusable. He relates a story from a chiropractor whose mother came home from a bowling league game crying because an MD on the opposing team had made a big stink that he wouldn\u2019t bowl against her husband just because he was a chiropractor. \n The AMA distributed \u201cQuack Packs\u201d and 10,000 copies of an anti-chiropractic book, Ralph Lee Smith\u2019s At Your Own Risk: The Case Against Chiropractic. The complete text of that book is available online. \n It had made an enemy of Scientology when it accused it of practicing psychiatry without a license. Smith says L. Ron Hubbard turned Dianetics into a religion just to escape AMA persecution, but it\u2019s my understanding that he deliberately set out to invent a religion. At any rate, Scientology was so mad at the AMA that it decided to help chiropractic retaliate against At Your Own Risk. Scientologists pilfered secret documents about chiropractic from AMA headquarters and published them in the book In the Public Interest. The book not only had ties to the Church of Scientology, but had a cover illustration that superimposed the AMA caduceus on a swastika. \n The Wilk Case \n In 1976 an antitrust lawsuit was filed by Chester A. Wilk and 4 other chiropractors (one of whom later dropped out) against not only the AMA but also against 9 other medical organizations such as the American College of Radiology, and against 4 individuals. This began an odyssey lasting 14 years, with two separate federal trials, a series of appeals, complicated legal wrangling, and conflicting evidence. Some of the defendants settled out of court; 6 organizations and one individual went to trial. The AMA won, but the judge was accused of improperly instructing the jury and allowing inaccurate documents into evidence, so there was a second trial. In 1987, Judge Susan Getzendanner dismissed the charges against some of the defendants but found the AMA guilty of violating Section 1 (but not Section 2) of the Sherman Antitrust Act. No damages were awarded. The AMA was only required to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 legal costs and to change its policy and inform MDs that they could associate with chiropractors. Chiropractors crowed about their victory, but it actually did little to change \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d practices or to enhance the reputation of chiropractic. \n The decision was not by any stretch of the imagination an endorsement of chiropractic. The judge said: \n The study of how the five original named plaintiffs diagnosed and actually treated patients with common symptoms was particularly impressive. This study demonstrated that the plaintiffs do not use common methods in treating common symptoms and that the treatment of patients appears to be undertaken on an ad hoc rather than on a scientific basis\u2026 \u00a0I am persuaded that the dominant factor was patient care and the AMA\u2019s subjective belief that chiropractic was not in the best interests of patients\u2026 [but]\u00a0this concern for scientific method in patient care could have been adequately satisfied in a manner less restrictive of competition. \n Saved By George \n He eulogizes chiropractor Jerry McAndrews and his brother George, the lead attorney in the Wilk v. AMA antitrust trial. The McAndrews family was heavily invested in chiropractic ever since their father\u2019s asthma was relieved by a chiropractic adjustment where his heels allegedly touched the back of his head. (Really? What kind of adjustment does that?) They blamed his early death on persecution by the AMA. George \u201csaved chiropractic.\u201d Had it not been for him, the AMA would have destroyed chiropractic just as it destroyed homeopathy, naturopathy and other alternative health care professions. (Wait \u2014 aren\u2019t those still around? And if chiropractic was saved, why is he still complaining?) Jerry reminisced to Smith, recalling that during the Wilk trial George\u2019s office was burglarized and their phones were tapped, forcing them to speak in the cornfields behind Jerry\u2019s home. (Really? Did they have any actual proof of wiretapping? Did they report it at the time? Did the corn have ears?) \n How Powerful is the AMA? \n The 1910 Flexner report attempted to reform medical education by recommending that American medical schools adopt higher standards and adhere to science. Smith thinks that the Flexner Report made the AMA an invisible branch of the government and an accrediting agency. It didn\u2019t. He thinks the AMA controls the entire healthcare system, but today less than 30% of American physicians belong to it. \u00a0 It is a professional association that promotes the art and science of medicine, lobbies on issues that affect its members, and publishes several highly respected medical journals. The AMA never had any power to accredit or regulate physicians or punish them; the most it could do was deny membership. \n Smith really hates Morris Fishbein, AMA spokesperson and quackbuster who fought quack MDs like John Brinkley, the goat gland doctor . \u00a0He refers to Fishbein as a demagogue, dictator, Mussolini, and racketeer; he compares his persecution of chiropractors to Hitler\u2019s persecution of the Jews.\u00a0 He thinks Fishbein took dictatorial control of state licensing agencies. (Total nonsense!) \n To put Fishbein\u2019s anti-chiropractic campaign into perspective, it began in the 1930s, two decades after the Flexner Report. The value of science was widely accepted but evidence-based medicine was in its infancy.\u00a0 Until 1974, chiropractors were still not licensed in Louisiana, where they were still guilty of practicing medicine without a license. Fishbein encountered rampant quackery in product and drug sales, among conventional medical doctors and among people practicing medicine without a license. He fought against it wherever he found it, and he found reason to put chiropractic high on his list. \n Smith is irate because under Fishbein the AMA accepted advertising from tobacco companies, even touting the supposed health benefits of cigarettes. But they didn\u2019t know any better. As soon as they did know better, in the 1950s, when evidence of harm mounted, they stopped accepting tobacco ads, well before the first Surgeon General\u2019s Report was published. \n How powerful could the AMA be when it was not able to prevent the licensing of chiropractors in all 50 states or block coverage of chiropractic by Medicare? \n The Evidence for Chiropractic \n Smith contradicts himself. He re-defines what chiropractic claims to treat, saying that no displacement can be seen on x-ray but that there is a problem with function. Then he continues to speak of subluxations and of misalignments that require correction. Then he says obvious misalignments like scoliosis may not be problematic. He speaks of proper flow of nerve energy, saying spinal dysfunctions disrupt this flow to cause heart attacks and visceral disorders like dysmenorrhea, asthma, enuresis, and infantile colic. He even believes that spine dysfunctions can cause brain damage and premature aging. He believes that manipulation is effective in all these disorders. Worst of all, he believes there is credible scientific evidence to support these beliefs. (Maybe there is some \u201cevidence,\u201d but it isn\u2019t credible.) He claims that chiropractic has outgrown its origins and become more science-based, but in reality he sounds very much like D.D. Palmer. \n He relies on old, discredited evidence like the 1979 New Zealand Chiropractic Report. Its three-person panel consisted of a barrister, a chemistry professor, and a retired headmistress of a girls\u2019 school. It relied heavily on testimonials, failed to appreciate the scientific process, and demonstrated bias. \u00a0 He thinks it vindicates chiropractic, but its recommendations were actually devastating to chiropractic: chiropractors should be strictly monitored, should not present themselves as doctors, should not encourage patients to consult a chiropractor in preference to a medical doctor for any condition, and should not mislead the public into believing that chiropractic is an alternative to medicine. \n He ignores more definitive, up-to-date evidence that spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is effective but not superior to other treatments for low back pain and is ineffective for non-musculoskeletal conditions. Even the NCCAM damns it with faint praise: \n [Spinal manipulation] can provide mild-to-moderate relief from low-back pain. Spinal manipulation also appears to work as well as conventional treatments such as applying heat, using a firm mattress, and taking pain-relieving\u00a0medications. \n He quotes Gary Null, Natural News , and Dana Ullman (all infamous on this blog.) He devotes several pages to attacking Ann Landers for being in cahoots with the AMA and getting her information from them. (Isn\u2019t it reasonable for a non-medical columnist to consult medical experts to ensure accuracy?) \n His defense of chiropractic is based on questionable evidence plus fallacious arguments from popularity, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. Also the argument from antiquity: Hippocrates and Imhotep wrote about it. (No, they didn\u2019t write about chiropractic; they wrote about manipulation.) \n He doesn\u2019t understand what science means. He calls chiropractic \u201can unorthodox science.\u201d He says the first chiropractor was not unscientific. I explained in a previous post why chiropractic is not scientific. \n Strokes \n He presents the Cassidy study as if it were definitive proof that chiropractic neck manipulation doesn\u2019t cause strokes. He fails to report or respond to the criticisms of that study . \n He downplays the risks of chiropractic, resorts to tu quoque arguments about the risks of medical care, and cites the low cost of chiropractic malpractice insurance. He compares rate of neck manipulation stroke to rate of death from surgery (apples and oranges \u2014 but they are both fruits, so maybe I should say cabbages and carburetors!). He calls neck manipulation safe but doesn\u2019t consider the risk/benefit ratio (if there is no benefit, any risk is unacceptable). \n Back Surgery \n He devotes a great deal of space to criticizing doctors for doing back surgery, especially spinal fusions. He doesn\u2019t need to: the medical establishment itself has already criticized back surgery. It has recommended reforms: elimination of unnecessary and ineffective operations and sticking rigorously to indications that are evidence-based. Smith says the disc theory is dead. It isn\u2019t. He\u2019s right that too many back surgeries have been done for disc disease, but ruptured discs can cause permanent nerve damage and disability, and surgery can improve outcomes when done only for proper indications. He quotes a doctor who called for a moratorium on back surgery when he found that after 2 weeks of rehabilitation his patients no longer required surgery. Rehabilitation, not manipulation. Smith doesn\u2019t seem to realize this is as much an argument against chiropractic as against surgery. He doesn\u2019t admit that back surgery is ever indicated and he blames its use on the machinations of a medical industrial complex motivated only by profits. One wonders how much he really understands: at one point he even refers to the disc as cartilage. He seems to think proving that back surgeries are unnecessary equates to proving that chiropractic is effective; it doesn\u2019t. He calls for doctors to reform back surgery but doesn\u2019t call for reforming chiropractic to adhere to similar evidence-based standards. \n In 1994 a report by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) concluded that SMT was one of only 3 treatments for acute low back pain that were supported by evidence (the others were over-the-counter nonsteroidal drugs (NSAIDs) and heat/cold applications). The report didn\u2019t recognize chiropractic or even mention chiropractors. \n Because of the report\u2019s endorsement of spinal manipulation and its criticism of spinal surgeries, the North American Spine Society and the manufacturers of spinal fusion hardware sought an injunction to prevent its release. When that failed, NASS took the fight to Congress, where the agency\u2019s budget was cut and it was stripped of its ability to make treatment recommendations. Smith blames the AMA for this, although he does not show that they were involved. \n FSU \n He devotes 21 pages to the failed attempt to establish a school of chiropractic at Florida State University (FSU), an effort that was ridiculed in the famous campus map parody \u00a0showing other pseudoscientific departments like the Bigfoot Institute. The state legislature had appropriated $9 million annually to support such a school, with 151 votes for and only 1 against. So Smith claims FSU went against the will of the people. Ironically, nearby Life Chiropractic College opposed the bill because of fear it would lose students to a cheaper and more scientific program. Several FSU faculty members threatened to resign, and eventually the school\u2019s Board of Governors squashed the proposal, voting it down by a wide margin. 3 chiropractors at the Board meeting spoke out against a school. \n According to Smith, a noble cause was killed by medical demagogues and political subterfuge. He argued that it would have allowed chiropractors to explore the clinical scope of chiropractic and conduct research in an academic setting. \n He thought that MDs were only attacking chiropractic because it was based on a vitalistic philosophy, which doctors and scientists oppose because they are mostly atheists. He characterized the fight as a \u201creligious war to keep the heretics out of the medical den of iniquity.\u201d He also characterized it as an attack on academic freedom and compared it to the bigotry in America before Civil Rights, when desegregation led to resentment and deadly attacks. \n Raymond Bellamy, MD, orthopedic surgeon and professor at FSU (and husband of our own Jann Bellamy ), became the lightning rod leading what Smith calls an academic revolt. He characterizes Bellamy\u2019s effort as \u201cnot a studious argument as much as it digressed into a tirade of propaganda and slanderous accusations.\u201d He rants about Bellamy for several pages, accuses him of conflict of interest, and says \u201cinstead of demeaning black Americans as unworthy of a college education alongside white students, Bellamy and his mob debased chiropractors as unworthy of a university presence alongside them.\u201d He likens it to Creationists being allowed to ban the study of evolution from the biology program. He compares FSU to a white country club that only invites its white friends. \n He considers Bellamy the embodiment of the undercover dictatorship at FSU, says his book-burning mindset will go down in the annals of academia alongside the book-burning policy of Joseph Goebbels, accuses him of suppressing free speech, and even says: \n Gov. Wallace demonstrated his racial politics to the world and Dr. Raymond Bellamy felt justified with the same intense prejudice to keep the \u201cnigger-chiropractors\u201d out of FSU. \n Such despicable and defamatory accusations are beneath contempt and don\u2019t even deserve a response. \n He says \n The FSU project would have cleared the air on many issues and either proved chiropractic to be placebo as Bellamy contends or else it would have brought an ageless healing art to the forefront to help millions of people who suffer from both musculoskeletal disorders and those who suffer from spinovisceral reflex nerve disorders that mimic serious visceral disorders. \n In other words, chiropractic should be accepted in a university on equal terms with established sciences so we can then test it and find out if it is scientific (!?). Don\u2019t imagine for a minute that chiropractors would alter their practice if the tests found it to be unscientific. No, it would only give chiropractic a foot in the door and lend it a prestige it has not earned. \n Whining \n He admits that \u201ca small percentage\u201d of chiropractors can be viewed as charlatans, but then he makes excuses. They have been reduced to \u201cdesperation\u201d and they are not to blame because they have been \u201cghettoized.\u201d It is the medical societies who are to blame for any chiropractic malfeasance. \n He feels slighted because chiropractors are not featured on national TV as spokespersons on health like Dr. Sanjay Gupta and because there has never been a chiropractor TV hero like Marcus Welby. \n He says the AMA\u2019s war has left a lingering stigma harmful to chiropractic, but he himself undermines that argument: he says chiropractic has achieved its place as \u201cthe third-largest physician level health profession in the world, only behind medical physicians and dentists.\u201d Does he imagine that if prejudice were eliminated chiropractors would be first or second? Chiropractors are licensed in every state, are practicing in the VA and military hospitals, are funded by Medicare and insurance companies\u2026 and yet he still feels unfairly persecuted. \n Language \n His use of language is inflammatory and offensive. He calls the AMA \u201cthe most terrifying trade association on earth.\u201d Edzard Ernst is a \u201cmedical spin doctor.\u201d Stephen Barrett is a \u201crenowned medical propagandist\u201d and a \u201cmedical misinformer.\u201d The medical profession is guilty of war crimes. Suppression of chiropractic is a social injustice like racism and sexism. Marcus Welby is like Joseph Goebbels. Attacking chiropractic was like making Rosa Parks sit in the back of the bus. Doctors are like storm troopers. He accuses the AMA of bigotry and of attacking free enterprise. He compares it to the KGB, Gestapo and CIA, and even mentions the showers of Auschwitz. \n Harriet Hall \u201cMedical Chauvinist\u201d \n He devotes 4 whole paragraphs to attacking me, based only on 2 short sentences attributed to me in an article about alternative medicine in the Boston Globe. It reported my concern that \u201cCongress will elevate [alternative] practitioners to the same level as medical doctors.\u201d He said \u201cHer arrogance was clear that there is no room on the medical throne for anyone other than MDs.\u201d He said I showed my \u201cbias\u201d when I said \u201cIf it [alternative medicine] were shown to be truly effective, it would be part of regular medicine.\u201d He countered that if conventional medicine were truly effective, we would not be in the present healthcare crisis \u2014 something of a non sequitur , no? He said I was \u201cspewing propaganda.\u201d And was a \u201cmedical monarchist\u201d who didn\u2019t want to see my \u201cmedical Bastille\u201d toppled by equality. (I certainly don\u2019t want to see science toppled by equality with pseudoscience and quackery.) \n Consider that my two quoted comments were about alternative medicine and didn\u2019t even mention chiropractic. Also consider that he didn\u2019t bother to find out that I have written extensively about chiropractic (which he could easily have discovered just by Googling my name) and he has not tried to answer any of my arguments against chiropractic. \n What He Doesn\u2019t Say \n Nowhere does he mention chiropractors like Sam Homola, a regular guest author here, who have criticized chiropractic from within. Nowhere does he mention that half of chiropractors are still undermining public health by discouraging immunizations. Nowhere does he acknowledge or respond to the arguments against chiropractic, for instance the wealth of material on Quackwatch\u2019s Chirobase, Homola\u2019s numerous books and articles, and magazine and blog articles by me, Steven Novella, David Gorski, and many others. Nowhere does he acknowledge the critiques of the Cassidy stroke study and the other studies he cites. \n What Might Have Been \n Throughout, he confuses chiropractic with spinal manipulation. They are not the same thing. SMT is a specific treatment also used by other practitioners including MDs, DOs, and PTs for specific indications; chiropractic is a whole system of care built around manipulation. Chiropractors do perform the majority of manipulations; but they do them for indications that the other professions do not accept, and many of them do a lot of other silly things that can only be described as quackery. \n The Flexner report resulted in accreditation standards that closed half of American medical schools. Most schools of competing medical systems like homeopathy, naturopathy, and eclectic medicine closed. Many osteopathic schools stayed in business by bringing their schools into compliance with Flexner\u2019s recommendations. Chiropractic might have done the same, but it didn\u2019t. \n The AMA fought optometrists the same way they fought chiropractors. Optometrists were in competition with ophthalmologists for the eye market, and the AMA tried to prohibit MDs from associating with them, but they lifted the prohibition when faced with an anti-trust lawsuit similar to Wilks .\u00a0 Optometrists agreed to play a limited role within mainstream medicine; they are licensed to do only certain of the many things ophthalmologists do. Chiropractic might have done the same, but it didn\u2019t. \n What if chiropractic had policed its own ranks, limited itself to providing only short-term treatment for certain types of musculoskeletal pain, worked hard to determine which manipulation techniques were most effective, abandoned techniques that it found ineffective, and denounced vaccine rejection, applied kinesiology, and other forms of quackery? Manipulation might have been more widely accepted as a therapeutic tool if it had not been so tainted by the company it kept. Chiropractors could have become \u201cphysical therapists for the back,\u201d experts in manipulation that MDs could refer patients to with confidence.\u00a0 Chiropractic might have been integrated into the medical mainstream just like osteopathy and optometry, but it didn\u2019t even try. \n Not Recommended \n The AMA did some bad things in pursuit of a good end (fighting quackery), but Smith\u2019s book does bad things in pursuit of a bad end (promoting unscientific health care). \n I didn\u2019t buy the book. I requested it from my public library through Interlibrary Loan. They had to search far afield for a copy, and they eventually located one in a library 2370 miles away, the Texas Chiropractic College Library. From the date due sticker, it appears to have never been checked out. I can only suspect the book is not very popular or widely read, even by chiropractors. I don\u2019t regret reading it, because I learned a few things about history and about the thinking processes of chiropractors; but it left a very bad taste in my mouth and I certainly can\u2019t recommend it."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-war-against-chiropractors/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://nccam.nih.gov/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.sptimes.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 5, "http://www.chirobase.org/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["There\u2019s a saying in medicine that we frequently hear when a newer, more effective therapy supplants an older therapy or an existing therapy is shown not to be as efficacious as was once thought, and it has to do about how long it takes for the use of that therapy to decline. The saying basically says that the therapy won\u2019t die out until the current generation of established physicians retire and are replaced by the new generation coming up through medical schools. From my perspective, it\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration, because in the mere 13 years that I\u2019ve been a real doctor (i.e., an attending physician) our practices in breast cancer surgery has changed markedly. Although certain core principles of breast cancer care remain the same, there have been major changes in terms of how we deal with the axillary lymph nodes, our use of hormone therapy and chemotherapy, and our very understanding of the different subtypes of breast cancer. Of course, I have spent my entire career as faculty at two different NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers; so my experience is not representative of that of most physicians, particularly given that I\u2019m super subspecialized. It\u2019s generally expected that if you\u2019re faculty in an academic medical center you will be at the very least up to date, if not beyond at the cutting edge. \n Even so, there is some truth to the observation that it takes the rise of a new generation of physicians to force out certain old ideas, which means that how we train our medical students is of utmost importance. Unfortunately, these days, it is medical students who have become a major force for promoting the \u201cintegration\u201d of quackery into medicine (which these days is known as, appropriately enough in a way unintended by its proponents, \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d). No, I\u2019m not saying that all or even most medical students are prone to the blandishments of quackademic medicine, but rather that there is a large enough contingent of medical students who have gone beyond being shruggies to become activists for unscientific medicine. There are CAM clubs, CAM interest groups, and student-driven CAM electives. \n And then there\u2019s the American Medical Students Association (AMSA), specifically its various initiatives in \u201c integrative medicine .\u201d I fear that each successive generation of medical students is more prone to embracing unscientific medicine than the last. \n \n AMSA and CAM: A long history together \n On its website, AMSA describes itself as the oldest and largest independent association of physicians-in-training in the United States. Founded in 1950, it currently boasts a membership of approximately 68,000 medical students, premedical students, interns, and residents. The goals of the organization, as described on its website, are as follows: \n \n Quality, Affordable Health Care for All \n Global Health Equity \n Enriching Medicine Through Diversity \n Professional Integrity, Development and Student Well-Being \n \n It\u2019s hard to argue with any of these aims as goals, but, of course, as always the devil is in the details. For instance, AMSA has managed to cause some controversy with its PharmFree initiative, which is fine on the surface, but, as some argue, might have unintended consequences . Another problem is that AMSA declares itself to be all about the evidence and evidence-based medicine, as well as ethics. This would be great if it were true, but there\u2019s one big hole in the claim. It\u2019s a hole big enough to pilot an aircraft carrier through, and that hole is, to put it briefly, \u201ccomplementary and alternative medicine\u201d (CAM). To boil it down, AMSA promotes integrating quackery into medicine, and it does it in a big way. Let\u2019s see how. \n I first became aware of how AMSA promotes \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d several years ago, when Dr. R. W. Donnell pointed it out to me . This led me to a document, still available on the AMSA website on a page called the ICAM Resource Center (Integrative, Complementary and Alternative Medicine), Complementary Therapies Primer (formerly \u201cThe Quick and Dirty Guide to Complementary Therapies\u201d) and the 2006 UCSF Guide to Integrative Medicine . I\u2019ll get to the primer in a minute. First, let\u2019s look at AMSA\u2019s position on CAM laid out on its ICAM webpage: \n \nAMSA believes that students and physicians can best serve their patients by recognizing and acknowledging the availability of integrative medicine in their communities. By pursuing education in complementary and alternative medical (CAM) treatments, medical students and physicians can better facilitate the appropriate education, treatment and counseling of patients and consumers. \n \n AMSA believes that an empowered patient can serve as a powerful and central actor in their own healing. \n Appropriate education in CAM treatments uses scientific and ethnographic methods, including quantitative and qualitative outcomes research of efficacy and effectiveness. Although it is informed by evidence, it considers explanatory models and cultural. \n AMSA supports students who wish to work within the healthcare system to create an environment which is supportive of the whole patient. \n AMSA believes that medical students and other health care professionals need to be restored and whole in order to be empowering and healing for their patients. \n \n \n Let\u2019s look at numbers one, three, and four first. These are nothing more than CAM-speak blather worthy of one of Kimball Atwood\u2019s installment of Weekly Waluation of the Weasel Words of Woo . For instance, there is nothing in SBM that says an \u201cempowered patient\u201d is a bad thing or that he can\u2019t serve as a \u201cpowerful and central actor\u201d in his own healing. Indeed, as I\u2019ve pointed out before many times, paternalism is steadily going away within EBM/SBM, and most physicians of my generation and younger agree that\u2019s a good thing for the most part. We want our patients to be engaged and provide input into their care and what\u2019s important to them. Most of us don\u2019t feel comfortable anymore taking a \u201cdoctor knows best\u201d attitude in which we simply give orders and prescriptions and expect to be obeyed. This brings us to number three, which is what I like to call the \u201cholistic\u201d trope, in which CAM practitioners claim to be so much better than conventional medicine at caring for the \u201cwhole patient.\u201d It\u2019s utter bunkum, nonsense, a fetid pair of dingo\u2019s kidneys. A good science-based primary care doctor is a holistic doctor! A good science-based primary care doctor does take care of the \u201cwhole patient.\u201d A good science-based primary care doctor also \u201cempowers\u201d the patient. None of these things are inherent in or exclusive to CAM, nor are they unachievable in SBM. It\u2019s a false dichotomy that AMSA fully buys into, lumping its CAM promotion initiatives under \u201chumanistic medicine.\u201d Again, I resent that \u2014 I don\u2019t need CAM to practice \u201chumanistic medicine.\u201d \n More importantly, let\u2019s look at number two, how AMSA supports using both \u201cscientific and ethnographic methods\u201d and claims that appropriate education in CAM uses explanatory models and culture. While this is not completely unreasonable on the surface (certainly to understand how traditional Chinese medicine came about one has to understand a bit about the Chinese culture out of which TCM sprang), but notice the not-so-subtle denigration of science. Notice how AMSA considers qualitative and quantitative outcomes research and doesn\u2019t even mention proper randomized clinical trials (RCTs), unless one assumes it to be subsumed under \u201cscientific\u201d methods. Odd that it\u2019s not mentioned, though, isn\u2019t it? Well, no, it\u2019s not so odd. As we\u2019ve discussed many times, CAM proponents are very much enamored of \u201cpragmatic\u201d research, of the sort that seeks to see how various modalities perform in \u201creal world\u201d settings. The problem with this emphasis is that pragmatic studies and outcomes research are not appropriate for modalities that have not yet been shown to be efficacious and safe in proper clinical trials. The reason for \u201cpragmatic\u201d research is to test whether treatments shown to work in RCTs do as well once they are let \u201cout in the wild,\u201d so to speak, where they will be used to treat patients who might not have fit the inclusion criteria of the RCTs used to test the treatment or in hospitals and settings where the capabilities for monitoring the therapy might not be as good as they were for the RCTs. Doing outcome studies on therapies that haven\u2019t been validated in RCTs is putting the proverbial cart before the horse. \n Informational resources that AMSA recommends: Quackery \n Now, let\u2019s go back and look first at the UCSF guide. It begins with a disclaimer: \n Inclusion of a therapy, resource, or practitioner in this guide does not imply endorsement by UCSF, the Integrative Medicine Network, or the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine. \n Too bad this disclaimer and the frequent mention that many of these modalities are pure pseudoscience and that there are no good randomized clinical trial data demonstrating the efficacy of most of these treatments is belied by the utterly credulous description of various alt-med modalities found in many of the chapters. For example, check out this description of acupuncture: \n Acupuncture relies on the idea of Qi, the energy force that run in regular patterns called meridians through the body. A person\u2019s health is influenced by the flow of Qi in the body, in combination with the universal forces of Yin and Yang. If the flow of Qi is insufficient, unbalanced or interrupted, Yin and Yang become unbalanced, and illness may occur. By inserting fine needles on the body\u2019s surfaces at specific points to connect the meridians, acupuncture is used to regulate or correct the flow of Qi to restore health. \n At the initial visit, the practitioner evaluates the patient\u2019s current problems, medical history, available laboratory values and radiological tests, as well as a traditional physical exam of the tongue, reflex points, radial pulse, and external ear. The goal of the evaluation is to link the patient\u2019s problems to a specific imbalance or block of Qi \n Note how the description of qi is described as fact, not as an explanation that has no scientific basis for whatever effects (if any) acupuncture has on pain or disease in humans. Even in the section on scientific studies, there is no mention that qi has never been measured or detected, despite many attempts. But the description of acupuncture isn\u2019t that bad compared to some others. At least acupuncture has a potential physiologic mechanism for doing something , as misrepresented and exaggerated as it is. OK, over time I\u2019ve become less and less convinced of this; certainly claimed mechanisms do not persuade me. However, acupuncture does involve sticking needles in the skin. Not knowing anything else about it, one might think that something could be going on. In contrast, most homeopathic remedies are nothing more than water, pure placebo, but that doesn\u2019t stop the fine folks at UCSF from serving up another heaping helping of credulity: \n Dr. Hahnemann first formulated his principle of the Law of Similars after testing quinine, a cure for malaria. He found that it produced the symptoms of malaria in a healthy individual. However, when he discontinued the quinine, the symptoms disappeared. After several similar studies, Hahnemann found that very small doses of the substance are nontoxic and yet still work to produce the desired symptoms of the illness in healthy individuals. Homeopathic remedies are therefore diluted to different degrees so that only traces of the original substance are present. Often chemical testing will show no presence of the active ingredient. This, however, is completely consistent with homeopathic philosophy as they believe that the ingredient leaves an imprint on the remedy and it is this ghost print which then acts within the body. \n There are also several testimonials, just as good as that of any seen on Mercola.com or NaturalNews.com (or any alternative medicine website selling products). For example, here\u2019s one from a Reiki practitioner: \n \u201cI am a Second Degree Reiki Practitioner of the Mikao Usui Tradition. In the 10 years of my Reiki practice I have seen healing transformations in all my clients, on all levels (mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical). One patient that stands out most is a nurse for the U.S. Embassy that had been suffering from Shingles for nearly three years. After several hospitalizations and medical evacuations for treatment, she called me for an appointment. She was on daily doses of morphine painkillers, was exhausted and in pain all the time and had gained a lot of weight. We began weekly Reiki treatments that lasted for about six months. During the six months, she first began sleeping well, feeling more energetic, reducing her morphine and ultimately eliminating all pain medicine, and arriving at full energy balance and recovery.\u201d \u2014 Lauretta Agolli, Reiki Practitioner \n This, of course, follows a credulous description of what Reiki is, although at least the manual does mention that \u201cReiki is not recommended as the sole treatment for potentially serious medical conditions, and its use should not delay the time it takes to consult with a health care provider or receive established therapies.\u201d Imagine my relief, after that lovely testimonial and the glowing description of Reiki that preceded this disclaimer. \n I could go on, but what\u2019s the point. The UCSF manual has credulous and, in some cases, promotional treatments of a wide variety of woo, including reflexology, Reiki, naturopathy, fasting, spiritual healing, and others, mixed in with the occasional less woo-filled modality, like biofeedback. But what disturbed me even more was some of the descriptions of treatments for specific diseases, for example cancer (of course). Take a look at this schizophrenic passage: \n Alternative therapies may be dangerous because they are often unproven and administered in lieu of traditional treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation. Using alternative therapies instead of conventional treatment for highly curable, early-stage cancers is not recommended. \n CAM therapies are also considered useful approaches to recurrence, metastatic cancers, and secondary cancers. \n In actuality, as far as the cancer goes, alternative therapies are no more useful for curing recurrent or metastatic cancers than for curing early stage curable cancers. The only reason they sometimes appear useful for early stage cancers is because most such cancers are cured by the surgery, with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy serving mainly to reduce the risk of recurrence. If you undergo surgery for an early stage tumor and use an \u201calternative\u201d medical therapy on top of that, you\u2019ve almost certainly added exactly nothing to the surgery, whereas chemotherapy and radiation produce measurable decreases in the risk of cancer recurrence. Basically, you got lucky. \n Worse, there are yet more credulous descriptions of all manner of cancer quackery, including megavitamins, \u201ccolon detoxification\u201d with coffee enemas (as in the Gerson/Kelley/Gonzalez protocol), antineoplastons, the same is found for all the other diseases discussed individually, all with liberal comparisons between the woo and the dreaded \u201callopathic\u201d medicine. Indeed, the only quackery I can think of that the UCSF manual does not mention, to its credit, is chelation therapy. \n That\u2019s where AMSA\u2019s very own manual comes in. While the UCSF manual is a bit\u2014shall we say?\u2014reticent about promoting the quackier therapies, the AMSA manual has no such compunction. For instance, on p.20, this is what AMSA says about chelation therapy: \n \nChelation is used to reverse the process of atherosclerosis by removing calcium from plaques. It is used to prevent myocardial infarction and stroke, and as an alternative to bypass surgery and angioplasty. Since it improves blood flow, it is also helpful in gangrene, intermittent claudication caused by peripheral vascular disease, and poor memory due in part to insufficient cerebral blood flow. Reduction in metal ions reduces inflammation caused by free radicals, and makes chelation therapy helpful in arthritis, scleroderma, and lupus. Chelation therapy has also been used to normalize cardiac arrhythmias, improve vasculogenic vision loss, reduce cancer mortality, protect against iron poisoning and detoxification of snake and spider bites. \n Chelation therapy involves between twenty and thirty treatments given at intervals of two to seven days. Each treatment takes approximately three and a half hours, and involves the intravenous infusion of EDTA, vitamins and minerals. Oral chelation is also effective for patients with mild disease, or as a preventive measure. EDTA and penicillamine (another chelating agent used in heavy metal poisoning, Wilson\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis) can be used orally, leading to reduced serum cholesterol.\n \n The only warning given about chelation therapy provided is to point out that chelation therapy is \u201ccontraindicated in pregnancy, renal failure (the drug is cleared by the kidneys), and hypoparathyroidism (due to its calcium-binding properties).\u201d There\u2019s no mention that it doesn\u2019t work, that it doesn\u2019t clear plaques from coronary arteries, or that it doesn\u2019t do anything for autism. \n Then there\u2019s this description of homeopathy: \n \nThe Law of the Infinitesimal Dose was formulated by Dr. Hahnemann when he experimented with dilute solutions, seeking to avoid toxicities, and found them to be more effective than full strength preparations. Homeopathic remedies are repeatedly mixed with water or alcohol and shaken (succussion), often diluting the substances to such a degree that no amount of the original medication can be found in the remedy. Some believe that the remedies retain their effect because of electromagnetic frequency imprinting, changing the structure of the diluent subtly. \n Initially, as a patient is treated by a homeopathic physician, he or she may actually worsen. This is know as a \u201chealing crisis.\u201d As the presenting, most recent, symptoms are treated, older, underlying disorders come to the surface. Dr. Constantine Hering, the father of American homeopathy, believed that healing progresses from recent diseases to chronic maladies, from emotional imbalances to physical disorders, from superior to inferior, and from the deep structures to the superficial. This is known as Hering\u2019s Laws of Cure. By following Hering\u2019s Laws when treating a patient, a practitioner can successively unravel many layers of pathology, eventually recreating internal order and achieving a more permanent cure.\n \n The skeptical take included in this guide? It\u2019s mentioned that homeopathy has \u201clost favor with the medical establishment in the US\u201d (gee, that couldn\u2019t possibly be because homeopathy is a load of pseudoscientific rubbish with a mystical vitalistic overlay, could it?), after which a 1991 BMJ study finding that most controlled clinical trials suggested a beneficial effect of homeopathic remedies is cited. Unfortunately, there are also similarly credulous takes on a wide variety of dubious, non-science-based therapies, including aromatherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic, naturopathy, and others. I can see AMSA apologists retorting that this particular guide was written in 1995, making it 17 years old and potentially out of date. If that were the case, however, why would AMSA not remove it from its website as one of its suggested resources? Ditto the UCSF guide. Alternatively, AMSA could add a note to its 1995 guide pointing out that chelation therapy is dangerous and doesn\u2019t work or remove that section altogether. It hasn\u2019t. At worst, this failure implies endorsement of this particular form of quackery; at best, it implies indifference to whether chelation therapy is science- and evidence-based or not. The same could be said for all the other quackery credulously discussed in these two tomes of pseudoscience. \n If the above doesn\u2019t convince you, just peruse AMSA\u2019s webpage for its Naturopathic Medicine Interest Group , which not only represents naturopathy as scientific but actively encourages interactions and \u201ccross pollination\u201d between medical students and naturopathy students, complete with a link to a list of alternative medicine conferences . \n Promotion of CAM and a bootcamp for quackery \n Unfortunately, AMSA goes far beyond simply providing unscientific and pseudoscientific information on its website and falling for typical distortions of language used by CAM apologists. In other words, it goes beyond words into deeds. For instance, if you peruse AMSA\u2019s website, it won\u2019t take you long to find several initiatives related to CAM. One example is AMSA\u2019s Educational Development for Complementary & Alternative Medicine (EDCAM), whose goals are described as: \n \n Improve medical student proficiency in CAM theory, methods, and practice; \n Enhance medical student education of preventive health, holistic care, and self-care through clinical examples using integrative medicine; and \n Improve cultural competence and comfort of future physicians increasingly exposed to a diversity of world populations and healing methods. \n \n To manage that, EDCAM has created modules whose use it encourages medical schools to use in their curriculum that it refers to as Core Curriculum CAM Integration in 10 categories. These include: \n \n Nutrition and Lifestyle: Diet, Exercise, Sleep and Stress Management \n Mind-Body Medicines \u00a0 \n Alternative Systems of Medical Thought: Traditional Chinese Medicine, Kampo, Tibetan Medicine and Acupuncture \u00a0 \n Alternative Systems of Medical Thought: Yoga, Ayurveda, Native American and Yoruba Based Medicines \u00a0 \n Alternative Systems of Medical Thought: Homeopathy and Flower Essences \u00a0 (updated 5/03) \n Bioenergetic Medicines \u00a0 \n Pharmacologic/Biologically Based: Herbal Medicines \u00a0 \n Pharmacologic/Biologically Based: Nutrition, Dietary Supplements and Vitamins \u00a0 \n Manipulative Therapies: Chiropractic and Osteopathy \u00a0 \n Manipulative Therapies: Therapeutic Massage \n \n Let\u2019s take a look at one of these, the section on bioenergetic medicines. This is a subcategory of CAM commonly referred to as \u201cenergy healing\u201d and includes therapeutic touch, reiki, and several others. The objectives described include being able to: \n \n understand the concept of subtle energy, the vital force, qi, and prana and their roles in medicine, now and historically. \n define the terms bioelectromagnetic medicine, biofield therapies, biofield, frequency, electromagnetic field, magnet therapy, medical qigong, Reiki, therapeutic touch, and external qi. \n explain how energy medicine works according to our present scientific understanding and discuss what scientific questions and controversies still remain, discussing the scientific loopholes in studying bioenergetic fields. \n understand what skeptics say about energy medicine, and what scientific arguments are used to refute those claims. \n explain the present and most promising future applications of bioelectromagnetic therapies, citing some key studies showing effectiveness of bioelectromagnetic therapies. \n list the main types of biofield therapies used in the U.S. and know what they are clinically used for. \n discuss several key studies examining effectiveness of biofield therapies. \n experience some form of biofield or bioelectromagnetic energy practice. \n \n \n AMSA states that \u201cbioenergetic medicine\u201d (BEM) can be used to treat bone fractures, soft tissue injuries, chronic venous insufficiency, osteoporosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and others. Interestingly, the most recent references cited to support these claims date back to the 1990s. Instead of stating that there is no evidence that the \u201clife energy,\u201d \u201cvital force,\u201d or qi exists, this is what the BEM section states: \n \nThe biofield refers to the complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body that has been proposed as a super-regulator of health and healing (Rubik, 2002). Besides the EM components of the biofield emitted by the brain (EEG) and heart (ECG) that are well known in conventional medicine, the human biofield may also consist of more subtle energy fields as elaborated in Oriental Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, and other indigenous systems of medicine. \n This subtle energy, vital force, or cosmic life energy is a key concept in many CAM modalities, and it is referred to by the many terms listed above from various medical systems (Rubik et al., 1994a). Such vitalistic principles underlie many CAM modalities besides energy medicine, but have been banished from conventional medicine. This fundamental philosophical difference is at the root of medicine\u2019s divided legacy (Coulter, 1994).\n \n Amusingly, the BEM module does cite Emily Rosa\u2019s famous study of therapeutic touch that demonstrates that it doesn\u2019t work and tries to refute it: \n \nSeveral methodology issues were questioned in this study: 1) consistency of the distance between the experimenter\u2019s and subjects\u2019 hands, 2) lack of reference or use of methodology used by TT experts in 28 prior quantitative studies, 3) lack of accounting for conditions during which HEF cannot be detected by those denying desire for interaction with proper intention. Researchers have concluded in other studies that college students can sense another\u2019s intention to interact with them (Schwartz 1995, 1998).\n \n One notes that the two studies cited that claim that college students can detect another\u2019s intention to interact with them appeared in a journals called Subtle Energies and the Journal of Scientific Exploration . Interestingly enough the Subtle Energies website triggered a malware warning on Safari when I tried to access it; so I didn\u2019t. Maybe its energies are more powerful than expected! Be that as it may, neither journal is what I would describe as reputable, and neither study is a good study. (Maybe I could go into detail on another occasion.) None of the other modules are any better, either. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the homeopathy module, where one of the objectives is to \u201cdiscuss the scientific controversies and questions that remain for homeopathy and explain basic evidence for and against its clinical application.\u201d There are no \u201cscientific controversies\u201d about homeopathy. It is water; it is a placebo. How many times does this need to be pointed out? \n Unfortunately, this is the sort of stuff that AMSA wants to place in medical school curricula, and, to a large extent, it\u2019s succeeding. \n In case that isn\u2019t enough, though, AMSA goes far beyond informational resources, helpfully providing its AMSA Medical School CAM Directory , which allows a fast and easy search of CAM programs at various medical schools for medical students looking for CAM electives and sponsors an International Integrative Medicine Day . If that\u2019s still not enough, AMSA offers what is in essence a boot camp for students who want to become leaders in integrative medicine, which it calls Leadership and Education Program for Students in Integrative Medicine (LEAPS into IM) . LEAPS into IM is designed to groom future thought leaders in CAM and integrative medicine by choosing 30 students to take part in a week long retreat at the Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health in Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts. If that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s also a month long retreat offered known as the Humanistic Elective in Alternative Medicine, Activism and Reflective Transformation (HEART): \n \nSpecific sessions will be focused on intentional community building, complementary and alternative/holistic and integrative medicine, social justice and activism, reflective transformation including meditative practices, and personal growth skills such as communication and intention. Any clinical site visits will demonstrate ways to incorporate social justice and patient advocacy into clinical care.\n \n There\u2019s nothing like tying the idealistic impulses of young people to indoctrination in pseudoscience and quackery, is there? \n Finally, for students who can\u2019t travel to Massachusetts next June or give up a month of their lives for HEART, there is an online CAM course AMSA calls the Integrative Medicine Scholars Program that allows students interested in integrative medicine to learn and interact online. \n Conclusion \n As admirable as many of AMSA\u2019s initiatives might be, it is very clear that, when it comes to the promotion of nonscientific medicine, AMSA is far more part of the problem than the solution. I wish it were otherwise, but it is not. That being said, I realize that the \u201chumed\u201d (humanistic medicine) contingent of AMSA is the minority, and my conversations with numerous medical students leads me to believe that many of them quite correctly take a dim view of AMSA\u2019s promotion of woo in the medical school curriculum. Unfortunately, the majority of them are also shruggies , much like most of physicians they will \u201cgrow up\u201d to join and ultimately replace, which probably explains why they don\u2019t band together to do something about AMSA\u2019s blatant promotion of pure quackery. How to get medical students more interested in science-based medicine and willing to confront the infiltration of pseudoscience into their main professional organization is the most pressing issue supporters of SBM have in medical education. One wonders what would happen if an SBM-minded group of students tried to form an SBM interest group within AMSA. We can only encourage, offer help to interested students, and hope."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-american-medical-student-association-a-corrosive-force/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://alternativemedicineconferences.com": 1, "http://www.kripalu.org": 1, "http://www.amsa.org/": 16, "https://sites.google.com/": 1, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 13, "http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/": 2, "http://jama.jamanetwork.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["Topics, as I noted a fortnight ago in my uniquely misspelled and ungrammatical way, never die**. Or even fade away. There are popular ideas that persist in the world that have little to do with reality. In the reality based world of medicine there are concepts that refuse to die. Atelectasis causing fever or the need to \u2018double cover\u2019 Pseudomonas . Neither are true, yet every year medical students tell me that is what they have been taught. It is said the only way new ideas take hold is for those that hold the old ideas to die off. So maybe 50 years from now those medical myths will be gone. \n Popular culture also its myths. Take the immune system. Please. It is not a bicep that can be made stronger with a little exercise. It is a complex network of cells and proteins. There are antibodies (IgG (with five subtypes, IgM, IgA, IgE),the complement pathway, polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, lymphocytes in a profusion that rivals beetles. God, I think, has an inordinate fondness for lymphocytes.\u00a0There is the Toll system, the cytokines and lymphokines, the non-specific\u00a0defenses\u00a0like cilia and mannose binding lectin and on and on and on. \n I have a journeyman\u2019s understanding of the immune system, what is needed to understand why a given patient has an infection, although there is little I can do to reverse the immunologic defects: abnormal antibodies from Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s or low mannose binding lectin levels from liver disease are not amenable to clinical intervention. The most interesting discoveries concerning the immune system over the last few year has been the elucidation of the many polymorphisms in the immune system that can increase or decrease the risk of a variety of infections. \n The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, \n But in ourselves, that we are underlings. \n Often what determines health or infection, life or death, is a single amino acid substitution, say, in a Toll like receptor or the structure of our snot. \n Of course these variations in the immune system are not absolute risks, they are relative risks. Health and illness are complex and a career medicine and infection control has continually emphasized that it is rarely one thing that leads to health or illness. It is the confluence of multiple factors, death by a thousand cuts. \n There is no validity to the concept, the myth, of boosting your immune system. Metaphor time. Think of the body as a meat machine, like a car made out of steak. Mmmm. Steak. You can be properly tuned and maintained, the fluids and gas topped off, the air in the tires at the proper pressure. It will run optimally. You can\u2019t over tune the car or fill tank past capacity. There is an optimum you can\u2019t go beyond. \n It is similar with the immune system. There are certainly habits that will have everything running suboptimally, and by altering those habits get the function close to its theoretical optimum. That is the things you learned in second grade: good diet, exercise, avoid tobacco, a good nights sleep. All the things we know we should do but, the flesh being weak, we often avoid. \n Also, in my world, we call the boosted immune system an inflammatory response: when, in response to assault from the microbial world, the body gets a bit of a turbocharge, kicking the Batmobile into high speed. For the short term, it is of benefit. The infection is removed or suppressed. But because the immune system is not a clean, beautiful system but the result of that ever sloppy process called evolution, kicking it into overdrive is not without its downsides. As I have mentioned ad nauseum in my infectious disease podcasts, inflammation is prothrombotic and the downside of many infections is an increased risk for stroke, heart attack and pulmonary embolism. If you really, truly, could boost your immune system, you would almost certainly increase your risk for thrombotic events. \n So when someone says they can boost your immune system ask yourself, are they offering advice that takes what is probably a sub-optimally functioning human characteristic and nudging it towards some closer approximation of improved function or are they offering to make you better than an optimal baseline. \n As I have spent the last 5 years in the world of Supplements, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (SCAM) I have also tried to come up some classification system, with little success. \n There are two kinds of people in the world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people, and those who don\u2019t. \u2013 Robert Benchley. \n There are, broadly, two kinds of SCAMs. There are those that are based on total hooey: acupuncture, reiki, homeopathy, and Mitt\u2019s health care plan*. \u00a0And there are the SCAMs that take a wee bit of in vitro laboratory work or small clinical trials and conflate the results out of all proportion, usually translating into products sold by the proponent of the intervention. I am always amused by the accusation of being in the pocket of big pharma, when I do not get dime one for any antibiotic or vaccine I prescribe, but so often those that suggest various supplements for your illness somehow also sell them. Go figure. \n If you are offering some SCAM advice it is important to mix and match with legitimate, effective therapies. \u00a0It makes the SCAM look more reasonable, but if you mix cow pie with apple pie, it does not make the cow pie taste better; it makes the apple pie worse. \n The Natural News is good \u00a0source for all the above: useless therapies, overblown therapies and even, shock and horror, reasonable advice, all wrapped in a cocoon of really weird paranoia about government and big pharma. I am not conspiracy prone, preferring Hanlon\u2019s razor: \u201cNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\u201d \n The Natural News wants to boost your immune system. \u00a0Of course part of the purpose of boosting your immune system, but to avoid vaccines: \n \u2026illogically claiming that your lack of a vaccine somehow causes other people who are already vaccinated to catch the flu. Yeah, I know, it makes no sense, but then again the entire vaccine industry is based on the same fantasy logic as unicorns, fairies, leprechauns and garden gnomes. \n And, for the record, all the healthiest people walking around who don\u2019t catch the flu are the ones who refuse flu shots while taking care of their immune system. It\u2019s the vaccinated people who always seem to be sick for one reason or another, have you noticed? \n In any case, it\u2019s important to find ways to boost your immune system and shield yourself from colds and the flu without resorting to jabbing yourself in the arm with a cocktail of mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum and MSG. \n OK. Hanlon\u2019s razor? Or perhaps we should call it Pauli\u2019s Razor : Not only is it not right, it\u2019s not even wrong. \u00a0But I and others have written extensively on this blog about the flu vaccine and my purpose is not to discuss the flu vaccine. Instead I want to take a look at \n \u201c The top 20 ways to boost your immunity to colds and flu without using a vaccine \u201d \n There is no cold vaccine. I know. Picky. But I get the feeling the author doesn\u2019t understand basic microbiology. At one point they suggest an air filter to remove bacteria and molds, neither of which cause flu or colds nor suppress the immune system. \u00a0You can see the entire hodgepodge of the good, the bad and the ugly over at NN. I\u2019ll hit some highlights. \n 1) Take a vitamin D supplement every day. \n This is interesting and not yet completely worked out. Some groups who are vitamin D deficient have an increased risk of viral infection. However, those with normal levels get infections as well, but at lower rates. And it may not be the vitamin D level that is modifies your risk, but whether there are polymorphism in the vitamin D receptor. \n It is safe to say that being replete in vitamin D will lower your risk of some infections. Unless, of course, you are a proponent of the Marshal Protocol. Newtons law of Alternative Medicine: For every SCAM there is an equal and opposite SCAM. In the Marshall protocol you avoid vitamin\u00a0D as part of a complicated intervention where it is thought that bacteria and vitamin\u00a0D act together to shut down the immune system and the bacteria take off to cause disease. Go figure. \n But as a recent JAMA article demonstrated, taking vitamin D as a preventative for upper respiratory tract infection does nothing , although it may be of benefit in high doses to tuberculosis . \n It is not as simple an idea as take vitamin D and not get infected. It is, as with all vitamins, important to be replete. Outside of TB it is unlikely to be of help as a pharmaceutical. \n 2) Get as much sunlight as you can for as late into the year as you can manage. Even getting sunlight on just your face helps produce more vitamin D in your body. \n Always follow an overstatement with homey common sense advice. And he gives other good advice: wash your hands, get enough sleep, and avoid stress, as if anyone can do that after reading the rest of the advice. Trying to live up to all the other pieces of advice from the Natural News would be time consuming, expensive, ineffective and as a result be very stressful: \n Drink immune-boost beverages like organic Cocoa Mojo, which contains a blend of 4 medicinal mushrooms. Take Lomatium, Osha, Elderberry and more, avoid cleaners and cosmetics, eat more pungent spices, avoid cheese as it makes your nose stuffy (which is due to a lack of sinus circulation), Take Zinc and selenium. Take immune-protective herbal tinctures such as goldenseal, garlic, echinacea, osha root and elderberry. Eat more live vegetables. \n All of which, he says, is better than the flu vaccine, which works in 1 in 100 people. I read it on the Natural News: the flu shot works . He has the numbers wrong for efficacy, but he agrees it is effective. That is the take home message from the Natural News, the one that should be spread, \u201cFlu shots work\u2026\u201d since even at the mistaken number of 1 in 100, the vaccine is better than the nostrums and concoctions suggested, which have no proven utility. \n Most of the products are offered by the Natural News and most of which will do nothing. I didn\u2019t see the essay as an infomertial, but isn\u2019t that whole site? \n 15) At the same time, demand high levels of hygiene by those around you. Ask them to wash their hands, for example. Ask them to boost their immunity with herbs, nutrients and supplements that really work. In fact, when others fail to boost their immune systems, it\u2019s actually highly irresponsible on their part. \n To paraphrase the author from the beginning: \u201cThey\u2019re even starting to lay a guilt trip on those who refuse to boost their immunity, illogically claiming that your lack of immunity boosting somehow causes other people who are already boosted to catch the flu.\u201d \n Then there is the dangerous advice such as \n  Get off all medications that you can safely eliminate! Work with a naturopath to accomplish this, of course, as quitting medications cold turkey can also be dangerous. Most medications suppress your immune system, liver function, kidney function and even your reproductive function. \n and \n 16) Have an emergency supply of colloidal silver available. Not only do you want the liquid colloidal silver, you may also want to consider an inhalable form of silver like what you\u2019ll find in the Silver Lungs product. At the Natural News Store, we currently carry GHC\u2019s colloidal silver product called Silver Fuzion, and we\u2019ll soon be carrying Sovereign Silver products. \n and the just plain goofy: \n 12) Move your lymph! Rebounders (mini trampolines) are great for this purpose. Jumping rope also works, as does just hopping in place for a few minutes each day. You can also do arm rotations and other simple movements to keep your lymph circulating. Lymph movement is crucial for immunity. \n It is not, although there is this belief that lymph can stagnate, build up toxins and degrade immunity. This concept has as much basis in reality as qi and meridians. Finally there is \n 20) Laugh a little! Watch some comedy movies, or spend some fun time with family and friends. Laughter boosts immune function at many levels. It\u2019s good for your body and your mental health. Find creative ways to expose yourself to comical situations and you\u2019ll benefit as a result.  \n Well, after reading the Natural News I should be immune to everything forever. Nothing incites laugher more than this odd collection of the good, the bad and the ugly. \n ** The Duck-Arizona football game is more interesting, so blame any errors today on my alma mater. Go Ducks. \n * Ha. Just put that in there just to get your goat. An observation. I have given lectures for over 30 years. During the Clinton and Obama years I would make snide jokes about the powers that be and never had a complaint in the evaluations. Crack wise about a Republican and you will ALWAYS get a complaint. From that I conclude that Republicans are thin skinned whiney babies, although there may be other interpretations.

In another , we contemplated what it might mean for insurers to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against CAM providers, which is prohibited by the ACA. In both posts, the conclusion reached was that these provisions of Obamacare might not incorporate CAM practices into health care at the level CAM providers were hoping for. Here again we examine how the great expectations of CAM promoters may not be met in health care reform. \n This time, we take a look at some additional provisions of the ACA that CAM lobbyists and their friends in Congress managed to insert into the healthcare overhaul. Of course, whether the ACA is around for much longer will depend on the outcome of the November elections, although Gov. Romney\u2019s promise to \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d if elected president will happen only if his party wins a majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate.\u00a0 \n Patient-Centered Medical Home \n As part of its effort to bring down costs and improve healthcare, the ACA is all about primary care. Every person is to have a primary care physician coordinating his care, ideally in what is known as the \u201cPatient-Centered Medical Home,\u201d or \u201cPCMH.\u201d This is how the Kaiser Family Foundation defines the idea: \n A health care setting where patients receive comprehensive primary care services; have an ongoing relationship with a primary care provider who directs and coordinates their care; have enhanced access to nonemergent primary, secondary, and tertiary care; and have access to linguistically and culturally appropriate care. \n Actually, the PCMH existed as a model of health care delivery before the ACA, which simply adopted its tenets. It was largely developed by the by the National Committee for Quality Assurance [NCQA] with input from the American College of Physicians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Osteopathic Association. Notably absent from this list are any CAM provider organizations. From this collaboration NCQA developed a \u201cPhysician Practice Connections Recognition Program\u201d as a gold standard for medical practices. This model forms the basis of the NCQA\u2019s PCMH Recognition Program , which allows PCMH-recognized practices to take advantage of financial incentives offered by health plans and employers as well as government-sponsored programs, including grants and contracts offered by Medicare and Medicaid under the ACA. \n And guess who wants to be primary care providers under the ACA? Chiropractors. \n NCQA has six \u201cmust pass\u201d standards for PCMHs the application of which to any chiropractic practice will guarantee that no chiropractor will head a PCMH. One of these is that the PCP must \u201cPlan and Manage Care\u201d and chiropractors simply do not have the education and training to manage the wide range of conditions seen by a PCP. Three features of the care management requirement are deal-killers. Patient management has to include the ability to implement evidence-based guidelines. As Harriet Hall has amply demonstrated \u00a0even those who advocate most strongly for DCs as PCPs are unable to do this. As well, their \u201ceducation programs\u201d (actually, hotel conference room seminars) for primary care are grossly inadequate for actual practice as a PCP. Another is the requirement that the PCMH be able to manage medications and have the capacity for electronic prescribing. Since chiropractors can\u2019t prescribe the vast array of medications necessary for\u00a0primary care practice their becoming PCPs is simply a non-starter. \n Apparently unaware of the rigorous standards for PCMHs, The Foundation for Chiropractic Progress issued a white paper on \u201cThe Role of Chiropractic in the Patient-Centered Medical Home.\u201d Most of the document advocates for the chiropractor as a provider of services for back and neck pain and headaches. But, ever the optimists, the chiropractors assert that they also have a role as primary care providers, a subject we\u2019ve addressed here (and here and here ) at SBM a number of times.\u00a0The paper\u00a0provides these reasons in support: \n \n Patients may use a DC as a first point of contact within the healthcare system. (True, but they don\u2019t do it for primary care.) \n The American Chiropractic Association thinks it\u2019s a good idea. \n The Joint Commission recognizes DCs as \u201cphysicians.\u201d (True, but also podiatrists, dentists and optometrists, and no one is claiming they are PCPs.) \n Two states define\u00a0DCs as PCPs. \n \n Wow. I\u2019m convinced, aren\u2019t you? \n In fact, it doesn\u2019t appear Congress had DCs as PCPs in mind at all when it drafted the ACA. The law provides money for more training in family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics and physician assistants, but not DCs. The ACA also supports the creation of Community Health Teams through grants and contracts with HHS. These teams are \u201cto provide support services for primary care practices\u201d which, to be eligible for federal money, shall: \n Ensure that the health team . . . includes an interdisciplinary, interprofessional team of health care providers, as determined by the Secretary [of HHS]; such team may include medical specialists, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, dieticians, social workers, behavioral and mental health providers (including substance use disorder prevention and treatment providers), doctors of chiropractic, licensed complementary and alternative medicine practitioners and physicians assistants. \n If Congress thought DCs could be PCPs, why would it include DCs among the optional members of the health team run by the PCP? \n Finally, Medicare, the source of funding for many of HHS\u2019s demonstration projects, covers chiropractic only for \u201csubluxation\u201d correction. Despite what Daniel David Palmer thought that simply won\u2019t do as primary care. \n Even as part of the \u201chealth teams\u201d supporting PCPs it looks like there may not be much of a role for chiropractors and other CAM providers whose selection as part of the team is optional. Proponents of CAM and \u201cintegrative\u201d medicine are all excited about this provision because it specifically mentions them!!! Their enthusiasm might well be tempered with a look at a few other provisions. The ACA also provides that: \n In addition, the health team must: \n Provide coordination of the appropriate use of complementary and alternative (CAM) services to those who request such services. \n So, in sum: \n \n CAM must be provided only to those patients who request such services and its use must be \u201cappropriate.\u201d \n Medical team care must be \u201csafe and high quality care through evidence-informed medicine . . . and continuous quality improvements.\u201d \n Care must be cost-effective. \n Providers must \u201ccollect and report data that permits evaluation of the success of the collaborative effort on patient outcomes\u201d and identify areas for improvement. \n Providers must provide a care plan to the team for each patient and access to the patient\u2019s medical records. \n \n In other words, CAM providers will have to practice in a setting unlike any they have ever seen and will have other health care providers looking closely at what they do. I seriously doubt your usual CAM providers will be prepared for this kind of scrutiny, cost control limitations and performance evaluations. Nor will they be allowed to perform such nonsense as cupping , applied kinesiology and cranial sacral therapy and the like. (But wouldn\u2019t you just love to see the PCP\u2019s face when that report came up in the patient\u2019s medical record?) \n Accountable Care Organizations \n One of the other key patient care/cost saving devices of the ACA is the Accountable Care Organization, which the Kaiser Family Foundation describes thusly: \n A network of health care providers that band together to provide the full continuum of health care services for patients. The network would receive a payment for all care provided to a patient, and would be held accountable for the quality and cost of care. Proposed pilot programs in Medicare and Medicaid would provide financial incentives for these organizations to improve quality and reduce costs by allowing them to share in any savings achieved as a result of these efforts. \n Whether this model will work is the subject of some debate. And whether ACOs will incorporate CAM providers is not clear. Even an article in the CAM-friendly Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine , funded by (surprise!) the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), could make only a weak case for inclusion. The authors\u2019 pro-CAM argument centered mostly around the fact that CAM is popular and there are a lot of CAM practitioners, both of which are irrelevant to their inclusion in ACOs. And they optimistically note that the \u201cdeveloping empirical evidence on both cost and efficacy of CAM from ongoing research activities funded primarily by [NCCAM] will likely help inform which CAM services might be included in ACOs.\u201d I find their enthusiasm misplaced, as I know of no research which would support CAM inclusion in ACOs. \n But even these authors were forced to admit that \u201cdue to extreme diversity among CAM providers and newly emerging modalities . . . it [is] difficult to consistently define what constitutes CAM,\u201d a point we here at SBM have made numerous times. I do have to admire the careful wordsmithing which resulted in the phrase \u201cnewly emerging modalities,\u201d or what we might less charitably describe as \u201cthings people make up.\u201d As well, \u201cunless long-term benefits of CAM use for general health are proven empirically, CAM use for general health in ACOs will be controversial.\u201d I would say \u201cnon-existent,\u201d as no ACO is going to tolerate unproven treatments bringing down the all-important bottom line, which means less money for the other providers. Finally, \u201cshould CAM practitioner services become involved in ACOs, monitoring appropriate use will likely be a considerable challenge.\u201d In other words, they aren\u2019t used to being watched. \n Naturopaths made their own pitch for inclusion in ACOs. While the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP) correctly noted that naturopaths aren\u2019t covered providers under Medicare (which operates the ACA\u2019s ACO demonstration projects), they nevertheless implored HHS to consider them in a 2011 letter . In addition to the ubiquitous \u201cCAM is popular\u201d argument, they claimed that naturopaths are \u201chighly trained primary care providers\u201d whose standards are \u201con par with that of conventional medicine\u201d who \u201cplay a significant role in reducing the rate and impact of chronic disease in underserved populations,\u201d assertions all nicely refuted in a series of posts by Kimball Atwood, collected here . \n In their plea to HHS, the AANP could come up with only two studies to support their broad assertions of quality care. One was a small study of patients with back pain comparing the cost-effectiveness of \u201cnaturopathic care\u201d (acupuncture, relaxation exercises, exercise and dietary advice, and a back care booklet) compared to standardized physiotherapy education and a back care booklet. The other was unpublished results from a \u201crandomized controlled pragmatic trial of the whole practice of naturopathic medicine.\u201d \n CAM on Board \n The ACA also creates a number of Boards, Commissions and the like to provide advice on the healthcare system. CAM proponents managed to require that CAM providers be included as members. \n One of these new bodies is the National Health Car Workforce Commission, which the American Association of Family Physicians describes as: \n dedicated to making recommendations regarding health care workforce issues. According to some analysts, this commission could emerge as the dominant force in driving and shaping the nation\u2019s health care workforce policies. . . . The commission will make recommendations to Congress, the U.S. Department of Labor and HHS on a broad range of workforce-related topics, including national workforce priorities and goals, current and projected workforce supply, and needs and assessments of current education and training activities. \n The fifteen initial members were appointed in 2010, but nothing happened after that because Congress never provided funding. The members hold MD, RN, PhD, MPH, DDS, and JD degrees. There are also a couple of health care executives but no CAM practitioners. \n Where the ACA requires inclusion on other advisory bodies, CAM practitioners appointed hold advanced degrees as well as their CAM degrees and are but a few among many other practitioners, including MDs, RNs, dentists, MPHs, PhDs and the like, all with their own agendas. For example, CAM proponents seemed very excited about the \u00a0 Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health Council , which has one acupuncturist who is also an RN and Catholic nun on board (go figure). It also includes Dr. Dean Ornish. However, if the minutes of the first meetings are any indication, CAM is pretty much being ignored. \n Be careful what you wish for \n I wonder if CAM practioners really want to be a part of health care reform and question their enthusiasm at being included. It seems the last thing CAM providers would welcome into their practices is greater accountability, more supervision by MDs, DOs,\u00a0PAs and nurses,\u00a0access to their patient records, application of evidence-based standards, and required demonstrations of cost-effectiveness, all of which they\u2019ve pretty much avoided to this point."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/obamacare-and-cam-iii-great-expectations/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.naturopathic.org/": 1, "http://www.ncqa.org/": 2, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.mccoypress.net/": 1, "http://www.aafp.org/": 1, "http://healthreform.kff.org/": 2, "http://www.nih.gov/": 1, "http://www.gao.gov/": 1, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 12}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["One of the skills I try to teach medical students on their journey to becoming experience clinicians is to consider and address the patient\u2019s \u201cnarrative.\u201d Patients have a certain understanding of their illness, its cause, and its role in their life. They make sense of their situation as best as they can, resulting in a story they tell themselves. This is how humans generally deal with the complexities of life. \n There is a potential problem when the clinical narrative of the health care provider conflicts significantly with the illness narrative of the patient. Patients, for example, often feel that a highly specific diagnosis is necessary for optimal treatment of their condition. Until they are given such a diagnosis they feel they need to keep looking \u2013 for better diagnostic tests or different specialists (what I call the \u201cDr. House\u201d narrative). The appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for that patient, however, may not require a specific diagnosis, but rather eliminating certain diagnoses and then treating the probable category or clinical syndrome that remains. The clinical narrative, in other words, may be one of considering risks vs benefits with incomplete and imperfect knowledge. \n Increasingly, it seems, the conflict of narratives is taking on a larger scale \u2013 not just between one doctor and one patient, but between the medical community and patient communities. Perhaps this is one manifestation of the new social media generation. Take, for example, a recent controversy over a patient diagnosed with PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections). \n What is uncontroversial about this story is that Elizabeth Wray is a 16 year old girl who developed the rapid onset of some form of tic or obsessive compulsive disorder. She was diagnosed with PANDAS and treated, for a time, with antibiotics (for the presumed Strep infection). She was recently transferred to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital (BCH) for treatment, but her doctors there apparently disagreed with her previous management. They petitioned the state to take custody of Elizabeth partly so that they can have her transferred to a locked psychiatric unit. A judge recent decided that the state of Massachusetts would take temporary custody of Elizabeth while the case is being sorted out, but did not allow her transfer to the locked unit. \n As far as I can tell, those are the basic facts of the case. However these facts are woven into very different narratives. Part of the PANDAS patient community has taken up the call to free Elizabeth Wray. Most are quoting the family\u2019s attorney, such as this report: \n \u201cTheir daughter Elizabeth was admitted to BCH due to eating issues. This is the second family I have represented within two months regarding BCH with the same fact pattern. In both cases, BCH has immediately told the parents that PANDAS/PANS does not exist, cut off the child\u2019s antibiotics, reported the parents to Mass child protective services, and had the parents trailed by guards at the hospital. In both cases, BCH has actively encouraged children\u2019s services to remove the child from the custody of the parents unless the family signed a voluntary agreement to place the child in a locked psych unit.\u201d \n This is sickening. So very sickening. \n Please forward this to everyone you know. Parents who are dealing with PANDAS are going through so much. To have their child taken from them, by\u00a0 ignorant \u00a0doctors who claim the condition doesn\u2019t even exist? \n According to this narrative, PANDAS is a very real syndrome that affects many children and responds to treatment. However, most doctors are dismissive, ignorant, and arrogant and \u201cjust don\u2019t get it,\u201d so they deny the existence of PANDAS and as a result refuse needed treatment to desperate patients. There are a few mavericks willing to buck the system for their patients, and they are champions of a populist crusade against entrenched professional ignorance. Sometimes insurance companies also get to wear the black hats, or Big Pharma, or government regulators, or all three. \n It\u2019s a great story, complete with villains and heroes, and has at its core the hope of a treatment for a serious and frightening illness. It is perhaps naive to think that this powerful narrative can be addressed by something as cold and dry as scientific evidence. The narrative, in fact, shields itself from such evidence. \n The medical community, as you might imagine, has a very different narrative, one that you will read here on Science-Based Medicine quite often (yes, we have our own narratives that guide our thinking about often complex topics). According to the SBM or mainstream narrative, medicine is a complex business. It is especially difficult to identify new diseases and clinical entities. The creation of a new diagnosis must be done very carefully, with thoughtful scientific studies used in an open-minded way to explore all the complexities involved. Only when all the ducks are in a row can we confidently conclude that a new diagnosis is, in fact, a distinct entity, and not just a variant or misidentification of existing known diseases. Meanwhile, even before all the diagnostic questions can be answered, we need research to answer the basic question of how patients respond to specific treatments \u2013 what clinical features predict what kind of respond to which treatments? This is, as I alluded to above, not necessarily the same question as one of diagnosis. \n Often new ideas in medicine are controversial for years, even decades, before a consensus can be reached about this fundamental claims. And most new ideas in medicine turn out to be wrong, but slowly our medical knowledge grinds forward. \n How does PANDAS relate to the above narrative? A recent review found : \n The relationship between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or tics/Tourette\u2019s syndrome in childhood to antecedent group A streptococci (GAS) is unclear. One recent prospective cohort study found that more than 85% of clinical exacerbations in OCD/tic behavior in patients who met criteria for PANDAS had no relationship to GAS infection. Another study found no correlation between clinical exacerbations and changes in a variety of markers of brain autoimmunity, the proposed pathogenesis of PANDAS. A third recent study concluded that, compared with specialty clinic diagnoses, patients diagnosed with tics or Tourette\u2019s by physicians in the community were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with PANDAS without meeting the proposed criteria, most lacked supporting laboratory evidence of GAS infection, and they were more likely to be treated with unjustified short-term to chronic antibiotic and/or immunomodulatory therapy. \n Despite continued research in the field, the relationship between GAS and specific neuropsychiatric disorders (PANDAS) remains elusive. It is possible that GAS infection may be but one of the many stressors that can exacerbate tic/Tourette\u2019s or OCD in a subset of such patients. \n I have to stress that I am not an expert in this area, but reading as much of the published literature as I can, the above is essentially what I found. The syndrome of sudden onset neuropsychiatric symptoms certainly exists, and is reported in the literature . However, the pathogenesis is unclear \u2013 specifically its relationship to GAS. GAS may not be a specific cause, it may just be one of many possible triggers of an exacerbation of a syndrome that has another underlying cause or causes. Further, the more specific question of whether or not patients who meet diagnostic criteria for PANDAS respond to antibiotics has not been settled, but certainly those advocating for such treatment have not met their burden of proof that it is safe and effective. One researcher, Singer, has proposed moving to a new diagnostic label, CANS (childhood acute neuropsychiatric syndrome), which has the advantage of not making any assumptions about pathophysiology that are as yet unproven. \n The bottom line is that PANDAS remains uncertain and controversial. It\u2019s not implausible and I (I think like most clinicians) remain open minded about this disorder and are just waiting for better evidence to settle the issue. We\u2019re happy to listen to whatever the evidence has to say. \n It\u2019s difficult to express all of this complexity to a community of parents of children with a scary neuropsychiatric disorder who are just looking for treatment. The internet narrative of heroes and villains makes the job that much more difficult. \u00a0BCH seems to be caught in the middle of this controversy. They are not allowed to talk about this case, but a statement from BCH has stated that they do treat PANDAS. This suggests, as I suspected, the notion that they categorically deny the existence of PANDAS is a gross oversimplifcation of their position \u2013 suitable for a comic book villain, but not the complexities of modern health care. \n Conclusion \n Confronting common narrative in the public is critically important for proponents of science-based medicine. I do think this gulf can be bridged, mainly because there is vast common ground. Patient, their families, and the medical community do all want the same thing in the end \u2013 to do what is best for patients. Further there is still vast agreement that the scientific evidence is ultimately the best guide to what is best for patients. If we can agree to this common ground, then a much more productive discussion can be had about what the current evidence says, what further studies are needed, and what is the optimum management at present given our state of knowledge."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/a-pandas-story/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nih.gov/": 2, "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://bostinno.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["A correspondent sent me a link to an article \u00a0about the decision of the Wichita Falls (Texas) Independent School District to recommend that chiropractors be allowed to give sports physicals to junior high and high school students. Current policy limits examiners to physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. Adding chiropractors to this list would bring the district in line with policies in the rest of Texas, as well as in some other states. And it would \u201cgive parents more options.\u201d \n I\u2019ve written about the attempts of some chiropractors to assume the role of family doctors and why I think it is a terrible idea. The idea of allowing them to do sports physicals impresses me as somewhat less terrible, but not by very much. \n The Reasons for Requiring Sports Physicals \n The goals of the Pre-participation Athletic Exam (PAE) include: \n \n To identify athletes who should not participate because of high risk of injury or death \n To identify those who require further evaluation or treatment so they can participate safely \n To identify conditions that do not affect athletic participation but that should be treated \n To possibly identify those at risk for substance abuse, depression, violence, etc. \n To provide preventive health advice \n To satisfy legal requirements. \n \n According to a review article in American Family Physician \n \u00a0 Specific conditions that would exclude or limit athletic participation include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT interval syndrome, concussion, significant knee injury, sickle cell disease and uncontrolled seizures. Overall, about 1 percent of athletes who are screened are completely disqualified from sports participation. \n The greatest concern is the risk of sudden death. \n Sudden Cardiac Death \n In the 5 th century BC, Phidippides ran 25 miles to bring the news of victory in the battle of Marathon to Athens. After delivering his message to the archons, he collapsed and died. Sudden death during or immediately after athletic exertion continues to be a problem. Estimates of incidence range from one young athlete in 200,000 every year to 1 in 43,770 NCAA athletes and 1 in 3100 NCAA Division I male basketball players per year.\u00a0A Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation study of sudden deaths in trained athletes\u00a0identified 158 deaths, 85% due to cardiovascular causes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the most common cause. Physical exams are not very good at preventing these deaths. \u00a0115 of these athletes who died suddenly had had a standard preparticipation medical evaluation, and only 4 of them had been suspected of having cardiovascular disease. Of those 4, the abnormality responsible for sudden death was correctly identified in only one. \n An article in the Journal of Athletic Training characterized current screening methods as \u201cineffective and inefficient.\u201d The standard history and physical exam result in an extremely small number of significant cardiac findings. Screening ECGs have been proposed but are generally considered to be ineffective because of the high false positive rate. In a study of 501 college athletes, 75 had abnormal ECGs requiring further examination, but none of them led to restrictions from participation. \n Italy has an aggressive screening program that disqualifies 1.8% of athletes for \n \n physical features of Marfan syndrome; \n delayed femoral arterial pulses; \n single, wide or fixed splits in the second heart sound; \n systolic or diastolic murmurs of grade 2/6 or greater; \n irregular rhythms; or \n blood pressures greater than 145/90 mm Hg \n \n This\u00a0screening reduced the mortality of young competitive athletes by approximately 90%.\u00a0 But other sources show that the overall SCD incidence in Italy remains similar to that in the US. \n Screening all athletes with echocardiography would identify many athletes at risk for sudden death, but it would cost an average of $857 per patient.\u00a0 False positive findings may lead to expensive further evaluations, and there are emotional costs (worry, stress, persistent fear of death even after reassurance of normality). There are also false negatives. \n The American Heart Association has a list of recommended screening items\u00a0 including family history of sudden death and cardiovascular disease, personal history of 6 specific symptoms, 4 physical exam items, and parental verification.\u00a0In one review, only 17 of 43 state forms met AHA recommendations. \n Non-Cardiac Problems \n Blood pressure, weight and vision are tested. The PAE can identify patients with post-concussive sequelae to help prevent second-impact syndrome. Patients with a single eye, \u00a0sports injuries. Patients with seizure disorders can be dissuaded from high risk sports like high diving. Exercise induced asthma can be treated. Patients with sickle cell trait can be counseled about hydration and acclimatization. Old injuries can be assessed for complete healing. Tests like duck-walking (walking in a deep squat) can detect a torn meniscus. Eating disorders may be identified. Contagious skin infections may be spotted. \n There are other benefits. \u00a0The exam offers an opportunity to address prevention issues (smoking, seatbelt use, etc.). It can identify health concerns that don\u2019t directly affect participation but that need further evaluation and treatment. \n How Are Sports Physicals Done? \n There is a standard form for these exams that is recommended by several medical organizations.\u00a0Not all schools use this form, but all have some kind of history form to be completed by student and parents, and a checklist for things to be looked at in the physical exam. \n The history is the most important part of the process, identifying up to 78% of pertinent conditions.\u00a0 Unfortunately, as Dr. House says on the TV series, \u201cpatients lie.\u201d Children and parents are motivated to get clearance to play a sport and may intentionally omit or minimize symptoms or past illnesses/injuries that they think might disqualify them. The ideal examiner is the child\u2019s personal physician who already knows the health history and family history in depth. A family physician or pediatrician has the broad training to pick up potential problems in all areas. \n Other than the cardiovascular exam recommendations from the AHA, there is little guidance about which physical exam components are worthwhile. Should we have every patient duck-walk to test for meniscal tears in the knee? Is measuring every child\u2019s height really important? How often does a cursory exam for enlarged lymph nodes lead to a significant diagnosis? When the form calls for musculoskeletal exam of the wrist/hand/fingers, should we just look to see if all the fingers are there, or should we test strength, flexibility, and range of motion? What criteria define a significant finding in this context, and what actions are indicated for positive findings? We simply have no evidence to guide us. \n There are two ways to get these exams. Students can be seen by their personal physician; but this involves cost and inconvenience, and timely appointments may not be available. Some schools offer mass screening exams with an assembly line of stations where individual tasks are accomplished, like vision testing and BP measurement, ending with a station where a physician reviews the results and examines the patient. This method is cost-effective and time-effective, but it may decrease quality. \n I have participated in those mass screenings, and I hated them. They were a chore to be endured, with limited time for interactions with the patient and with little sense of purpose.\u00a0 Back when I was doing them we had no guidance and little understanding of what we should be looking for; and it easily degenerated into a perfunctory task of checking items off on a list with the feeling that it wasn\u2019t going to make any difference to anybody anyway. Only around one percent of patients have a disqualifying condition, and it can be very tedious to wade through the other 99.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always disliked doing routine physicals of any kind, because they are largely unproductive, as I explained in another post .\u00a0 Doing a physical in pursuit of a diagnostic problem is fun, stimulating, and rewarding. Listening to the normal hearts of 99 often shy and embarrassed teen and pre-teen strangers is not. I\u2019d much rather see a regular patient in my office and fill out the form based on a long-term relationship and a limited, directed physical exam. \n Who can do these exams? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n 5 states have no specific recommendations \n 21 states allow PAs and NPs to perform these exams \n 10 states allow chiropractors \n 1 state allows naturopaths \n Colorado allows chiropractors to do school physicals but requires special training and certification. \n \n Some PAs and NPs have enough training and experience to detect cardiovascular disease, but few chiropractors do. Specific training might bring selected chiropractors up to an acceptable level, but there are other considerations. They might miss things because they still would not have the broad experience of all kinds and severities of illness that physicians get with in-hospital training, and they might be influenced by belief systems that are outside the scientific paradigm.\u00a0 Less than half of chiropractors support immunization, many of them use bogus muscle testing (applied kinesiology), and many of them still imagine they are correcting mythical subluxations: those at least would have to be excluded. And they would have to be prevented from soliciting customers for chiropractic adjustments and from spreading misinformation. The whole thing is just too problematic. \n Questions and Answers \u00a0 \n Q: How effective is the sports physical for identifying health problems? \n A: Not nearly as effective as it could be. \n Q: Which health problems should preclude athletic participation or defer it pending further testing? \n A: Controversies exist; there are few absolutes, and the degree of risk varies with the magnitude of the problem. \n Q: Does the requirement for sports physicals reduce the rates of injury or death? \n A: There\u2019s some evidence that it does, but it\u2019s not entirely conclusive, and the reduction is likely small in magnitude.\u00a0 And even if barred from athletic programs a young person may choose to ignore advice and risk injury or sudden death by strenuous recreational exertions. \n Conclusion (AKA My Humble Opinion) \n Sports physicals have the potential to significantly reduce the risk of injury and death, but in actual practice they are often inadequate. They could be improved by standardization and more rigor, including uniform application of AHA recommendations. Ideally, they would be done by the child\u2019s family physician. Ideally, examiners would have specific training in what to look for and which exam procedures to use, training that will be problematic until we can support specific recommendations with better evidence. \u00a0Physicians and properly trained, experienced PAs and NPs are qualified to do these exams. Chiropractors and other alternative providers are not, even with special certification and training."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/sports-physicals-sudden-death-and-chiropractors/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.aacp.net/": 1, "http://www.wiaa.com/": 1, "http://www.timesrecordnews.com/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.aafp.org/": 2, "http://www.nih.gov/": 5, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["The 2012 election campaign is in full swing, and, for better or worse, health care is one of the major defining issues of the election. How can it not be, given the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also colloquially known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d was one of the Obama administration\u2019s major accomplishments and arguably the largest remaking of the American health care system since Medicare in 1965? It\u2019s also been singularly unpopular thus far, contributing to the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, as well as the erosion of Democratic control of the Senate. Given that this is a medical blog dedicated to discussing the scientific basis of medicine and not a political or health policy blog, I am not going to go into the reasons for a lot of this. What I am going discuss is a recent eruption of the central problem that led President Obama to make the PPACA one of the central policy initiatives, if not the central policy initiative, of his first term. That problem is the issue of people without health insurance , who number roughly 50 million , with a further estimate that 86.7 million people were uninsured at some point during the two year period from 2007 to 2008, representing about 29% of the total U.S. population under 65. \n The question that bubbled to the surface last week in the form of a statement by Republican challenger Mitt Romney, and a tear-inducing op-ed piece published yesterday in the New York Times by Nicholas Kristof entitled A Possibly Fatal Mistake , is what the health impact of not having insurance is for those millions of people. This is a question that can be addressed scientifically and is, despite its politically charged nature, correctly within the purview of science-based medicine. What to do about it, in contrast, is a matter for politics and public policy. So first let\u2019s examine the question. \n \n A clueless statement and an op-ed that puts a face on the problem \n Before we discuss the evidence regarding the health effects of being uninsured, let\u2019s look Romney\u2019s statement and why it resulted in so much blowback. Romney made his assertion during an interview with the editors of The Columbus Dispatch : \n \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a setting across this country where if you don\u2019t have insurance, we just say to you, \u2018Tough luck, you\u2019re going to die when you have your heart attack,\u2019\u201d he said as he offered more hints as to what he would put in place of \u201cObamacare,\u201d which he has pledged to repeal. \n \u201cNo, you go to the hospital, you get treated, you get care, and it\u2019s paid for, either by charity, the government or by the hospital. We don\u2019t have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d \n He pointed out that federal law requires hospitals to treat those without health insurance \u2014 although hospital officials frequently say that drives up health-care costs.\n \n Romney was referring to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), a federal law passed in 1986 under the Reagan administration that requires hospitals to provide care to anyone needing emergency treatment regardless of citizenship, legal status, or ability to pay. Hospitals may only transfer or discharge patients requiring emergency care after stabilization, when their condition requires transfer to a tertiary care hospital, or against medical advice. It is highly unlikely that any person who has ever worked in an emergency room or cared for the uninsured would make such a statement. Emergency rooms are not equipped to treat complex conditions; all they can do is to treat the acute problem. In addition, tertiary care hospitals receive a lot of patients admitted under EMTALA, who are transferred at the drop of a hat. Well do I remember my days as a surgery resident rotating in the county hospital, when we used to joke about the Friday afternoon phone calls to transfer patients who had failed a wallet biopsy. We even knew what time was the \u201cwitching hour,\u201d when we were most likely to get such calls. Of course, the problem with EMTALA was (and is) that there were no provisions for reimbursement for uncompensated care. Basically, hospitals were forced by law to eat the costs of caring for the uninsured. \n Since completing fellowship, I have held faculty positions in two of the 41 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers in the U.S., both of which take care of a lot of uninsured patients. In New Jersey, I used to take care of quite a few illegal immigrants. Here in Detroit, it\u2019s the uninsured and the poor, so much so that a large fraction of my practice is made up of the uninsured and Medicaid patients. I\u2019ve seen more women than I can remember who waited far longer than they should have to see a doctor for their breast cancer because they couldn\u2019t afford it. Over the years, all too often my patients have been symptomatic for quite some time, and when they finally do present their tumors are larger, more difficult to treat, and more likely to kill them. They represent the female equivalent of Kristof\u2019s uninsured friend Scott, who is the human face of the issue discussed in his NYT op-ed and tells his story: \n \nIn 2011 I began having greater difficulty peeing. I didn\u2019t go see the doctor because that would have been several hundred dollars out of pocket \u2014 just enough disincentive to get me to make a bad decision. \n Early this year, I began seeing blood in my urine, and then I got scared. I Googled \u201cblood in urine\u201d and turned up several possible explanations. I remember sitting at my computer and thinking, \u201cWell, I can afford the cost of an infection, but cancer would probably bust my bank and take everything in my I.R.A. So I\u2019m just going to bet on this being an infection.\u201d \n I was extremely busy at work since it was peak tax season, so I figured I\u2019d go after April 15. Then I developed a 102-degree fever and went to one of those urgent care clinics in a strip mall. (I didn\u2019t have a regular physician and hadn\u2019t been getting annual physicals.) \n The doctor there gave me a diagnosis of prostate infection and prescribed antibiotics. That seemed to help, but by April 15 it seemed to be getting worse again. On May 3 I saw a urologist, and he drew blood for tests, but the results weren\u2019t back yet that weekend when my health degenerated rapidly. \n A friend took me to the Swedish Medical Center Emergency Room near my home. Doctors ran blood labs immediately. A normal P.S.A. test for prostate cancer is below 4, and mine was 1,100. They also did a CT scan, which turned up possible signs of cancerous bone lesions. Prostate cancer likes to spread to bones. \n I also had a blood disorder called disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is sometimes brought on by prostate cancer. It basically causes you to destroy your own blood cells, and it\u2019s abbreviated as D.I.C. Medical students joke that it stands for \u201cdeath is close.\u201d\n \n I realize that right now I\u2019m referring to my anecdotal experience. However, one anecdote is that of a man who gambled and lost because health insurance was too expensive. The rest is my experience in a highly specialized field in a city with high unemployment and poverty. It is quite possible that such experience can be misleading, and certainly one of the key messages we promote on this blog is that anecdotal experience is inherently potentially misleading. (That\u2019s why it\u2019s the primary evidence used by promoters of unscientific or pseudoscientific medicine.) In a way, Kristof\u2019s friend\u2019s story would seem to confirm Romney\u2019s statement, at least on the surface. Scott did, after all, end up getting excellent medical care for his stage IV prostate cancer, and, although he probably could have afforded health insurance if he had stretched a bit, did make a choice not to purchase insurance. But, then, as I said, anecdotes can be misleading. \n The evidence \n Before we get into the data itself, it is not much of a stretch to imagine that not having health insurance would result in worse health outcomes. What I am trying to say using SBM-speak is that the hypothesis that people without health insurance will be more likely to have health problems and die unnecessarily than people who have decent health insurance is a hypothesis with a fairly high degree of prior plausibility. After all, if you\u2019re uninsured, you\u2019re less likely to see a physician except when you get sick, less likely to be able to pay for your medications (particularly if they are expensive), and less likely to undergo routine preventative care. It\u2019s thus plausible that being uninsured would be associated with an increased risk of death or poor health outcomes. None of this means we don\u2019t have to do the research and look at the evidence; all it does is to suggest hypotheses to test and emphasize that these hypotheses have a reasonable chance of being consistent with the data. \n Even twenty years ago, this question was of intense interest. One of the seminal studies examining the relationship between health insurance and health outcomes was published in JAMA by Franks et al. , who prospectively followed 4,694 adults older than 25 years who reported they were uninsured or privately insured in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I), a representative cohort of the US population from initial interview in 1971 through 1975 until 1987. They found a 25% higher risk of mortality in the uninsured after adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, education and income. This effect was evident in all sociodemographic health insurance and mortality groups examined. \n In 2002, the Institute of Medicine estimated that over 18,000 Americans between the ages of 25-64 die annually because of lack of health insurance, a number comparable to the number who died of diabetes, stroke, or homicide in 2001. Among the conclusions of this report: \n \n Uninsured adults are less likely than adults with any kind of health coverage to receive preventive and screening services and to receive them on a timely basis. Health insurance that provides coverage of preventive and screening services is likely to result in greater and more appropriate use of these services. \n Uninsured cancer patients generally are in poorer health and are more likely to die prematurely than persons with insurance, largely because of delayed diagnosis. This finding is supported by population-based studies of persons with breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancer and melanoma. \n Uninsured adults with diabetes are less likely to receive recommended services. Lacking health insurance for longer periods increases the risk of inadequate care for this condition and can lead to uncontrolled blood sugar levels, which, over time, put diabetics at risk for additional chronic disease and disability. \n Uninsured adults with hypertension or high blood cholesterol have diminished access to care, are less likely to be screened, are less likely to take prescription medication if diagnosed, and experience worse health outcomes. \n Uninsured patients with end-stage renal disease begin dialysis with more severe disease than do those who had insurance before beginning dialysis. \n Uninsured adults with HIV infection are less likely to receive highly effective medications that have been shown to improve survival and die sooner than those with coverage. \n Uninsured patients who are hospitalized for a range of conditions are more likely to die in the hospital, to receive fewer services when admitted, and to experience substandard care and resultant injury than are insured patients. \n Uninsured persons with trauma are less likely to be admitted to the hospital, more likely to receive fewer services when admitted, and are more likely to die than are insured trauma victims. \n Uninsured patients with acute cardiovascular disease are less likely to be admitted to a hospital that performs angiography or revascularization procedures, are less likely to receive these diagnostic and treatment procedures, and are more likely to die in the short term. \n \n In 2008, the Urban Institute updated the IOM numbers by applying the methodology used by the IOM to more recent Census Bureau estimates of the uninsured, and estimated that in 2006 there were 22,000 excess deaths that could be attributed to lack of health insurance. The Urban Institute also suggested that the IOM analysis might have underestimated the number of deaths resulting from being uninsured. Its rationale was as follows: \n \nThe underlying longitudinal studies on which IOM relied did not specify the impact of insurance coverage on mortality by 10-year age groups. Rather, they documented the relationship between insurance and mortality across the sum total of all surveyed age groups. The IOM\u2019s methodology implicitly assumed that insurance reduces mortality by the identical percentage for each 10-year age band, which the underlying research did not show. More grounded in the research would be an application of differential mortality estimates to all adults age 25\u201364, as was done for those longitudinal studies, rather than separately to each age group within this range. For 2000\u201306, this alternative approach raises the estimated number of excess deaths by an average of 20.5 percent a year.\n \n In 2009, in a study from Harvard Medical School and the Cambridge Health Alliance, Wilper et al. published updated estimate of excess mortality associated with lack of insurance in the American Journal of Public Health . This analysis used methodology similar to that of Franks et al. applied to the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), specifically 9,004 patients between ages 17 and 64 with complete baseline data for interview and physical examination. They found that the hazard ratio for death for the uninsured was 1.40 (confidence interval 1.06 to 1.84) compared to those with private health insurance. This particular study is the source of a rather famous number: 45,000 patients die due to lack of insurance each year. This particular study is at the high end of the estimates of excess deaths associated with lack of health insurance, which is why it not surprisingly often comes in for the most criticism, particularly given that it was supported by a partisan group, Physicians for a National Health Program . That\u2019s why I tend to view this study as an outlier, but even outliers can sometimes tell us something. Whether the Harvard study was an outlier or not, that same year, the IOM updated its 2002 report . One of its conclusions was: \n \nIn contrast, the body of evidence on the effects of uninsurance on adults\u2019 health has strengthened considerably since 2002. Numerous studies have addressed some of the methodological shortcomings of past research. As discussed further below, 17 observational and 13 quasi-experimental rigorous analyses have reported significant findings related to health insurance and adults\u2019 health (Table 3-3) (McWilliams, 2008). The quality and consistency of the recent research findings is striking. As would be expected, health insurance is clearly most beneficial for adults who need medical attention, particularly for adults with common chronic conditions or acute conditions for which effective treatments are available. Furthermore, national studies assessing the effects of near-universal Medicare coverage after age 65 suggest that uninsured near-elderly adults who are acutely or chronically ill substantially benefit from gaining health insurance coverage. \n There are 13 recent studies on the health effects of health insurance coverage for children, including 5 studies that used quasi-experimental methods (Aizer, 2007; Bermudez and Baker, 2005; Cousineau et al., 2008; Currie et al., 2008; Howell et al., 2008a). These studies suggest that health insurance is beneficial for children in several ways, resulting in more timely diagnosis of serious health conditions, fewer avoidable hospitalizations, better asthma outcomes, and fewer missed school days (Aizer, 2007; Bermudez and Baker, 2005; Cousineau et al., 2008; Currie et al., 2008; Damiano et al., 2003; Fox et al., 2003; Froehlich et al., 2007; Howell and Trenholm, 2007; Howell et al., 2008a,b; Maniatis et al., 2005; Szilagyi et al., 2004, 2006).\n \n But that\u2019s not all. Since it\u2019s my specialty, I\u2019ll start by looking at some of the evidence regarding the outcomes of breast cancer patients who are uninsured compared to those who have health insurance. For example, a study published this year examining the outcomes of 2,157 hospital admissions for women with spinal metastases from breast cancer. Analyses were adjusted for differences in patient age, gender, primary tumor histology, socioeconomic status, hospital bed size, and hospital teaching status. The investigators found that women operated on for spinal metastases from breast cancer tended to do worse and have a higher risk of death if they were uninsured than if they had private insurance. The authors concluded that the poorer outcomes observed among the uninsured were primarily due to the uninsured patients being significantly more likely to have a nonelective hospital admission and present with myelopathy. Although this study had some limitations, namely that it couldn\u2019t account for lesser quality private insurance (for instance, plans with high copays and/or poorer coverage) and variations in Medicaid eligibility by state. Also, the database used only includes in-hospital data and therefore couldn\u2019t examine long-term outcomes. \n Since surgery is also my specialty, I thought I\u2019d also point out that there is considerable evidence that being uninsured or underinsured is associated with worse outcomes after surgery. For example, a recent study published in the Annals of Surgery from LePar et al. at the University of Virginia examined outcomes from 893,658 major surgical operations and found that mortality was considerably worse in Medicare, Medicaid, and the uninsured than they were in patients with private insurance. Adjusting for age, gender, income, geographic region, operation, and 30 comorbid conditions eliminated the outcome disparity for Medicare patients, but Medicaid and uninsured payer status still independently conferred the highest adjusted risks of mortality. \n In fact, the list of conditions and procedures for which being uninsured is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality goes on and on: cardiac valve surgery , surgery for colorectal cancer , breast cancer treatment and outcomes , trauma mortality (including among children ), and abdominal aortic aneurysms , to name a few. Moreover, analysis of survey data from patients who were uninsured but then became old enough to be enrolled in Medicare suggests that \u201cacquisition of Medicare coverage was associated with improved trends in self-reported health for previously uninsured adults, particularly those with cardiovascular disease or diabetes.\u201d In summary, there is a large and robust body of evidence suggesting that people do, in fact, die because of lack of health insurance. \n Not so fast\u2026 \n Of course, for a question as complex and prone to confounders as whether lack of health insurance is associated with poorer outcomes, including mortality, there are always those who are not convinced by existing observational data. Certainly, lack of health insurance can be a marker, not a cause, for poor health and subsequent poor outcomes, and teasing out the various confounding factors is not a trivial task. Perhaps the most widely cited study questioning this relationship was featured prominently in an oft-cited article in the lay press by Megan McArdle in The Atlantic entitled Myth diagnosis . It\u2019s a study by Richard Kronick published in Health Services Research in 2009 that questions the IOM report from 2002: \n \nThese results demonstrate that if two people are otherwise similar at baseline on characteristics controlled for in the model presented in Table 3, but one is insured and the other uninsured, their likelihood of survival over a 2\u201316-year follow-up period is nearly identical. Further, I show that survival probabilities for the insured and uninsured are similar even among disadvantaged subsets of the population; that there are no differences for long-term uninsured compared with short-term uninsured; that the results are no different when the length of the follow-up period is shortened; and that there are no differences when causes of death are restricted to those causes thought to be amenable to the quality of health care.\n \n Basically, Kronick found no relationships between insurance status and mortality. While this study was large (600,000 subjects) and controlled, it is also an outlier, just as much as the Harvard study is an outlier. Again, that doesn\u2019t mean it was a bad study; outliers can often tell us something, and what Kronick seems to be telling us is that the magnitude of the effect on mortality associated with lack of insurance might not be as large as previously thought. Might. It is, remember, just one study, as large as it might be. McArdle might refer to Kronick\u2019s study as \u201cwhat may be the largest and most comprehensive analysis yet done of the effect of insurance on mortality,\u201d which sounds incredibly impressive, but the simple fact is that no single study can provide the answer, particularly to question as complex as whether having no health insurance status is associated with increased mortality and poor outcomes. Kronick\u2019s study also has a significant problem that was pointed out in this post by Ezra Klein , namely that people in poor health are more likely to seek health insurance, which would tend to obscure any positive relationship between health insurance and health status. \n McArdle also makes another argument against such a relationship: \n \nThis result is not, perhaps, as shocking as it seems. Health care heals, but it also kills. Someone who lacked insurance over the past few decades might have missed taking their Lipitor, but also their Vioxx or Fen-Phen. According to one estimate, 80,000 people a year are killed just by \u201cnosocomial infections\u201d\u2014infections that arise as a result of medical treatment. The only truly experimental study on health insurance, a randomized study of almost 4,000 subjects done by Rand and concluded in 1982, found that increasing the generosity of people\u2019s health insurance caused them to use more health care, but made almost no difference in their health status.\n \n I hate to say it, but McArdle is drifting rather close to Gary Null territory here, in which she seems to be arguing that whatever benefit having decent health insurance might convey, it\u2019s about the same as the harm that \u201cconventional\u201d medicine does. In other words, her argument seems to be that providing people more access to health care will cause as much harm as benefit, making it a wash whether one is insured or not. Of course, that argument cuts both ways, if you accept estimates of over 100,000 \u201cdeaths by medicine\u201d per year in that it would imply that having health insurance confers a benefit in terms of mortality reduction that is much larger than the numbers we have would suggest, making the imperative to improve health care coverage and decrease medical errors a much more reasonable conclusion from such an argument than concluding that striving for universal coverage would not reduce mortality. Be that as it may, more problematic is that like many proponents of dubious medicine and science, McArdle cherry picked the literature , choosing one study that is an outlier and a thirty year old study from the RAND Corporation that showed what she wanted and in essence dismissed the rest. In refuting McArdle, by J. Michael McWilliams, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Health Care Policy and Medicine at Harvard Medical School and an associate physician in the Division of General Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital points this out and speculates : \n \nHow many lives would universal coverage save each year? A rigorous body of research tells us the answer is many, probably thousands if not tens of thousands. Short of the perfect study, however, we will never know the exact number.\n \n Indeed. \n Policy implications \n The very term \u201cscience-based medicine\u201d was chosen intentionally. Medicine itself is not a science. It can\u2019t be. There are too many other factors that influence treatments, including patient preference, resource allocation, and level of skill of individual practitioners, to name just a few. Our central thesis is that medicine should be based on science and that the best health care is based on science. My purpose in writing this post was not to advocate for any specific solution to the problem of the uninsured, although people who know me know my politics and my position on the matter. Rather, it is to lay out the science studying the question of the relationship between health insurance status and health outcomes. While we do frequently say that correlation does not necessarily equal causation, in some cases the correlation is so tight that it strongly suggests causation. This is one such case. Given that there is no ethical way ever to do a randomized clinical trial in which people are randomly assigned to be insured or uninsured, much as is the case for examining health outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, we are forced to rely on observational and quasi-experimental data. Those data support the hypothesis that providing health insurance to as many people as possible is associated with better health outcomes and that lack of insurance is associated with poorer health outcomes. That is the science. When someone like Mitt Romney claims that no one ever dies from lack of insurance in the U.S., he is demonstrably wrong. \n What we as a society decide do with the results of the science examining this question is less a matter of science than it is of politics and policy."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/health-insurance-and-mortality/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.dispatch.com/": 2, "http://theincidentaleconomist.com/": 2, "http://www.urban.org/": 1, "https://download.nap.edu/": 1, "http://www.theatlantic.com/": 2, "http://voices.washingtonpost.com/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/": 1, "http://www.pnhp.org/": 2, "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 8, "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blog": 1, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 2, "http://www.iom.edu/": 1, "http://jama.jamanetwork.com/": 2, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["I\u2019ll begin with the possibly shocking admission that I\u2019m a strong supporter of the collection of ideas and techniques known as evidence-based medicine (EBM). I\u2019m even the current President of the Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine Association (EBVMA) . This may seem a bit heretical in this context, since EBM\u00a0 takes a lot of heat in this blog. But as Dr. Atwood has said, \u201cwe at SBM are in total agreement\u2026that EBM \u201cshould not be without consideration of prior probability, laws of physics, or plain common sense,\u201d and that SBM and EBM should not only be mutually in clusive, they should be synonymous.\u201d So I have hope that by emphasizing the distinction between SBM and EBM and the limitations of EBM, we can engender the kind of changes in approach needed to address those limitations and eliminate the need for the distinction. One way of doing this is to critically evaluate the misuses of EBM in support of alternative therapies. \n One of the highest levels of evidence in the hierarchy of evidence-based medicine is the systematic review. Unlike narrative reviews, in which an author selects those studies they consider relevant and then summarizes what they think the studies mean, which is a process subject to a high risk of bias, a systematic review identifies randomized controlled clinical trials according to an explicit and objective set of criteria established ahead of time. Predetermined criteria are also used to grade the studies evaluated by quality so any relationship between how well studies are conducted and the results can be identified. Done well, a systematic review gives a good sense of the balance of the evidence for a specific medical question. \n Unfortunately, poorly done systematic reviews can create an strong but inaccurate impression that there is high-level, high-quality evidence in favor of a hypothesis when there really isn\u2019t. Reviews of acupuncture research illustrate this quite well. \n \n Acupuncture is one of the most studied practices in complimentary and alternative medicine (CAM), and this means there is a large volume of research to evaluate. While one might expect this to be a good thing, making it easier to tell whether acupuncture is effective for any specific medical problem, the amount of research studies actually makes for muddy waters in which the truth about the clinical efficacy of acupuncture is difficult to discern. The more studies there are, the greater the chance of getting some positive results even for an ineffective therapy. If the quality or methodology of the studies is poor, the results will be unreliable. And if numerous such studies of questionable quality exist, it becomes easier to generate systematic reviews which appear to provide high-level supporting evidence that doesn\u2019t actually mean what it looks like it means. \n For example, a recent systematic review of the use of acupuncture for pain following stroke appeared in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine . \n Jung Ah Lee, Si-Woon Park, Pil Woo Hwang, Sung Min Lim, Sejeong Kook, Kyung In Choi, and Kyoung Sook Kang.\u00a0 Acupuncture for Shoulder Pain After Stroke: A Systematic Review. The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. September 2012, 18(9): 818-823. \n The conclusion seems quite promising; \u201cIt is concluded from this systematic review that acupuncture combined with exercise is effective for shoulder pain after stroke.\u201d Given that a systematic review is high-level evidence, this ought to provide us with a fair degree of confidence that acupuncture is useful for this problem. \n But a more detailed look casts a bit of doubt on this conclusion. For one thing, 453 studies were identified and only 7 met the quality criteria for inclusion. This suggests that, even in the eyes of acupuncture researchers, most acupuncture research is lousy. And the 7 studies that were chosen for evaluation were all conducted and published in China and all showed positive results. Their results may have as much to do with how research is conducted and published in China as with the efficacy of acupuncture for this problem. \n While there is no question that some great scientific research is done in China, there is evidence for a systematic problem with the conduct and publication of alternative medicine studies there. Studies reported as randomized are\u00a0 most often not actually properly randomized. And one review in 1998 found that\u00a0 no negative study of acupuncture had ever been published in China. This strongly suggests that the acupuncture literature coming from China is unreliable due to poor methodological quality and a high risk of publication bias. \n A review of systematic reviews published in the same journal as the review of acupuncture for shoulder pain also supports a skeptical interpretation of the first paper. \n Bin Ma, Guo-qing Qi, Xiao-ting Lin, Ting Wang, Zhi-min Chen, and Ke-hu Yang.\u00a0 Epidemiology, Quality, and Reporting Characteristics of Systematic Reviews of Acupuncture Interventions Published in Chinese Journals. \u00a0 The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. September 2012, 18(9): 813-817. \n These authors identified and evaluated systematic reviews of acupuncture research published in China and these were their findings: \n Results: A total of 88 SRs were identified; none of the reviews had been updated. Less than one third (27.3%) were written by clinicians and one third (35.2%) were reported in specialty journals. The impact factor of 53.4% of the journals published was 0. Information retrieval was not comprehensive in more than half (59.1%) of the reviews. Less than half (36.4%) reported assessing for publication bias. Though 97.7% of the reviews used the term \u201csystematic review\u201d or \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d in the title, no reviews reported a protocol and none were updated even after they had been published after 2 or more years. \n Conclusions: Although many SRs of acupuncture interventions have been published in Chinese journals, the reporting quality is troubling. Thus, the most urgent strategy is to focus on increasing the standard of SRs of acupuncture interventions, rather than continuing to publish them in great quantity. This suggest that most systematic reviews of acupuncture published in China don\u2019t search the literature thoroughly and don\u2019t evaluate it properly. Given existing evidence that much of the research being reviewed is itself questionable, there is ample reason to be suspicious of the conclusions of such systematic reviews. \n When supporters of acupuncture claiming to follow the principles of evidence-based medicine cite systematic reviews, there is a strong possibility that these reviews don\u2019t actually fairly present the balance of the evidence. If they are poor quality reviews based on a biased sample of questionable studies, then they can only serve to create an inaccurate impression of the efficacy of acupuncture. \n And there are\u00a0 systematic reviews of the systematic reviews for acupuncture which have found that the balance of the evidence does not suggest a benefit from acupuncture: \u201cIn conclusion, numerous systematic reviews have generated little truly convincing evidence that acupuncture is effective in reducing pain.\u201d A large number of studies makes it possible to generate high-level evidence both for and against a hypothesis, in this case concluding both that acupuncture does and does not relieve pain. That only further clouds the issue since naturally everyone cites those reviews which support their a priori position on acupuncture. \n Another way of evaluating the state of the evidence on a given intervention is to compare the quality of studies with the likelihood of positive results. Dr. R. Barker Bausell has reviewed the acupuncture this way in his book\u00a0 Snake Oil Science. As it turns out, the highest-quality studies of acupuncture consistently find\u00a0 acupuncture works no better than placebo and that using\u00a0 fake needles and\u00a0 even jabbing the skin in random places with toothpicks work just as well as \u201creal\u201d acupuncture. Lower quality studies are more likely to be positive. This too sheds doubt on the reliability of positive clinical trials. \n As supporters of acupuncture will undoubtedly point out, this doesn\u2019t prove acupuncture doesn\u2019t work in those conditions for which systematic reviews have stated it does work. It does show, however, that a lot of time, energy, and money has been spent on acupuncture research without generating a consistent body of evidence that can support it or justify any great confidence. \n Which raises the issues of plausibility and\u00a0prior probability,\u00a0often cited as the primary sources of contention between between SBM and EBM. In theory, I do not object to clinical trial testing of interventions without well-established theoretical foundations. As\u00a0 Sir Austin Bradford Hill , one of the early luminaries of clinical epidemiology, put it, \u201cWhat is biologically plausible depends upon the biological knowledge of the day.\u201d As CAM proponents delight in pointing out, sometimes wacky ideas prove true. \n What they often fail to acknowledge, though, is that science does a pretty good job of accommodating such surprises if they can prove themselves through rigorous testing. The theory that\u00a0 Helicobacter could cause duodenal ulcers was considered implausible when proposed in 1982 , and it won a Nobel prize for the proponents of the idea in 2005. That\u2019s a pretty quick acceptance of an initially controversial idea, and it\u2019s not consistent with the caricature of mainstream science as closed-minded and dogmatic. \n In the real world, however, crazy ideas are far more likely to turn out to be wrong than revolutionary.\u00a0 Dr. Sanden\u2019s Electric Belt was at least as wacky as the idea that bacteria cause ulcers, but it has faded into history without any recognition from the Nobel committee. When time, money, and talent are limited (and they always are), spending them on ideas unlikely to bear fruit is hard to justify. \n While a perfect world might allow for thorough, methodical testing of every possible practice, in this world we owe it to our patients to focus our energies on those ideas most likely to result in real help for them, those ideas which build on established knowledge rather than asking us to ignore or overturn it. \n Finally, some sort of reasonable limit on the time and resources committed to investigating an idea is needed. When an adequate effort has been made and a strong, consistent body of evidence has failed to emerge, it is time to move on. \n In the case of acupuncture, the original theoretical mechanisms invoked to explain why it should help (Ch\u2019i, meridians, and so on) are vitalistic and inconsistent with established science. Attempts to find alternative mechanisms have yielded some interesting information about physiology and the mediation of pain sensation, but they have not turned up a coherent, unified theory of action supported by good evidence. And enormous numbers of clinical trials have been done over decades, again without yielding a consistent body of evidence supporting a specific therapeutic effect for acupuncture beyond the placebo effects of the therapeutic ritual. \n So determining the truth about acupuncture requires more than simply looking for published systematic reviews. The quality of these reviews, and the studies they evaluate, must be critically appraised and the evidence at all levels, not simply clinical trials, must be considered. Finally, the proposed mechanisms by which acupuncture might work must also be critically evaluated to see if they are supported by good evidence and are not strongly at odds with established scientific knowledge. It is a misuse of evidence-based medicine to simply conduct poor quality systematic reviews on poor quality trials with a high risk of bias and then take the conclusion of these reviews at face value. A more comprehensive look at the question and the evidence at all levels is required. This is what is meant by science-based medicine, and it is what good evidence-based medicine should be."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/chinese-systematic-reviews-of-acupuncture/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.painjournalonline.com/": 1, "http://scienceblogs.com/": 2, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.nih.gov/": 2, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2, "http://online.liebertpub.com/": 2, "http://www.amazon.com/": 1, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 1, "http://skeptvet.com/Blog": 2, "http://www.ebvma.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["Your health insurance plan probably covers anti-inflammatory drugs. But does it cover acupuncture treatments? Should it? Which health services deliver good value for money? Lest you think the debate is limited to the United States (which is an outlier when it comes to health spending), even countries with publicly-run healthcare systems are scrutinizing spending. Devoting dollars to one area (say, hospitals) is effectively a decision not to spend on something else, (perhaps public health programs). All systems, be they public or private, allocate funds in ways to spend money in the most efficient way possible. Thoughtful decisions require a consideration of both benefits and costs. \n One of the consistent positions put forward by contributors to this blog is that all health interventions should be evaluated based on the same evidence standard. From this perspective, there is no distinct basket of products and services which are labelled \u201calternative\u201d, \u201ccomplementary\u201d or more recently \u201cintegrative\u201d. There are only treatments and interventions which have been evaluated to be effective, and those that have not. The idea that these two categories should both be considered valid approaches is a testament to promoters of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), who, unable to meet the scientific standard, have argued (largely successfully) for different standards and special consideration \u2014 be it product regulation (e.g., supplements ) or practitioner regulation . \n Yet promoters of CAM seek the imprimatur of legitimacy conferred by the tools of science. And in an environment of economic restraint in health spending, they further recognize that showing economic value of CAM is important. Consequently they use the tools of economics to argue a perspective, rather than answer a question. And that\u2019s the case with a recent paper I noticed was being touted by alternative medicine practitioners. Entitled, Are complementary therapies and integrative care cost-effective? A systematic review of economic evaluations , it attempts to summarize economic evaluations conducted on CAM treatments. Why a systematic review? One of the more effective tools for evaluating health outcomes, a systematic review seeks to analyze all published (and unpublished) information on a focused question, using a standardized, transparent approach to evidence analysis. When done well, systematic reviews can sift through thousands of clinical trials to answer focused questions in ways that are less biased than cherry-picking individual studies. The Cochrane Review\u2019s systematic reviews form one of the more respected sources of objective information (with some caveats ) on the efficacy of different health interventions. So there\u2019s been interest in applying the techniques of systematic reviews to questions of economics, where both costs and effects must be measured. Economic evaluations at their core seek to measure the \u201cbang for the buck\u201d of different health interventions. The most accurate economic analyses are built into prospective clinical trials. These studies collect real-world costs and patient consequences, and then allow an accurate evaluation of value-for-money. These types of analyses are rare, however. Most economic evaluations involve modelling (a little to a lot) where health effects and related costs are estimated, to arrive at a calculation of value. Then there\u2019s a discussion of whether that value calculation is \u201ccost-effective\u201d. It\u2019s little wonder that many health professionals look suspiciously at economic analyses: the models are complicated and involve so many variables with subjective inputs that it can be difficult to sort out what the real effects are. Not surprisingly, most economic analyses suggest treatments are cost-effective . Before diving into the study, let\u2019s consider the approach: \n \n What do you mean, cost-effective? \n Whenever you hear any treatment described as \u201ccost-effective\u201d, you should immediately ask, \u201cCost-effective compared to what?\u201d Cost-effectiveness evaluations consider incremental costs and incremental benefits, and cannot be considered in isolation: \n \n  \n ( Source: www.acponline.org ) \n \n The \u201cCE ratio\u201d is the effective additional cost for the additional benefit offered by a new strategy or treatment. If the new strategy provides better outcomes at the same or lesser cost as the current practice, then the new strategy is said to be \u201cdominant\u201d \u2014 that is, it should be accepted immediately. If the new strategy provides worse outcomes at a higher cost, then current practice is said to dominate \u2014 the new strategy should be abandoned. Few studies are this simple, however. Most published economic analyses tend to show interventions that claim better efficacy at a higher cost. (For an example, see the economic evaluation of virtually every new drug launched in the past 30 years.) If the CE ratio is low, the treatment is said to be \u201ccost-effective\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of benefit for a modest additional cost. If the incremental cost is high, relative to the incremental benefit, the CE ratio is high, and the new strategy is deemed \u201ccost-ineffective\u201d. By now it should be clear that what\u2019s cost-effective is ultimately a judgement call. What\u2019s felt to be cost-effective might be influenced by how much money you have to spend, or how you prioritize your spending. \n Given the number of variables in an economic analysis, the opportunity for bias is high. It all depends on the design. Some of the major considerations include: \n What is the comparator? All cost-effectiveness evaluations compares one intervention to another. Substituting homeopathy for antibiotics for the treatment of colds may be a cost-effective intervention. After all both are ineffective, and homeopathy may be less expensive than antibiotics. What\u2019s further, there is the risk of harm from adverse events due to drug, while homeopathy is inert, without medicinal ingredients. Does that mean homeopathy is \u201ccost-effective\u201d for colds? Not quite. Giving \u201cno treatment\u201d for a cold is superior to (or \u201cdominates\u201d) both antibiotics and homeopathy, as it is both safe and free of cost. If the comparator is inappropriate, and any derived cost-effectiveness estimate is irrelevant. \n Just how effective is the intervention? In general, effective interventions tend to be cost-effective. Some are even cost saving. Vaccines are one example. Interventions, science-based or otherwise, that offer modest and very incremental benefits, may be deemed a cost-ineffective use of resources. Screening programs, for example, can be clinically effective, but tremendously cost-ineffective when you factor in harms of false-positives. Again, the best evidence for efficacy usually comes from prospective, randomized trials. Evidence can be derived from other settings, and there may be very good reasons why randomized data is unavailable (once again, vaccines are an example of this). However, this needs to be factored into the evaluation when considering overall effects, and the risks of bias. So when we\u2019re looking at interventions, we need to consider not only the trial from which the economic evidence is derived, but the totality of evidence for that intervention. There are multiple studies that suggest that acupuncture has clinically meaningful effects. But the best and most comprehensive studies repeatedly conclude that acupuncture\u2019s effects are placebo effects . If there is any doubt about the clinical effect of the intervention, then the economic analysis must reflect this. Otherwise, the value-for-money evaluation will be hopelessly biased. Recall the study of acupuncture for asthma that observed patient-reported improvements, but no objective improvements in control . Depending on what endpoints you base your economic model on, your conclusion will be very different. \n How realistic is this intervention? Like any other clinical trial, data from research must be translated into the real world. If the interventions can be offered in the real world in a way that\u2019s consistent with the trial, and the real-world patients are similar to those studied, we\u2019d generally agree that a particular study is generalizable. As we move further away from the type of intervention studied and the types of patients that participated, the relevance of the clinical study to the real world becomes less clear. Patients in clinical trials behave differently than those in regular, everyday treatments. When we move from highly controlled trials to more pragmatic studies, we generally expect treatment effects to decline. This isn\u2019t the case with CAM \u2014 rigorous studies show a lack of effect, while more \u201cpragmatic\u201d trials, studying real world use, are more likely to report benefit. While the treatment setting may be more realistic, the ability to distinguish objective effects from subjective effects may be more difficult. \n What is the type of analysis? Different models answer different questions. Cost-effectiveness analyses compare the costs and effects of different treatments, when you can measure the effect objectively. Cost-benefit analyses are used to answer questions about overall benefits in a population, such as public-health interventions. Cost-utility analyses require measurement of effects that can estimate \u201cquality-adjusted life years\u201d or QALYs. \n These are the big four, but there are several other areas that need to be scrutinized in an evaluation, including the accuracy of the measurement tools used, the assignment of accurate costs to different outcomes, and the overall sensitivity of the model to small changes in estimates. The key point to remember is that with so many knobs and buttons, any economic analysis can make a health treatment look good \u2014 especially if the clinical evidence it\u2019s based on is favorable. \n Given the variables that need to be examined, economic analyses don\u2019t lend themselves systematic reviews, which are designed to synthesize all relevant information to answer a focused clinical question. And that seems to be the case with the paper in question. These authors attempt to use the framework of a systematic review to examine the economic evidence supporting CAM treatments. The lead author is Patricia Herman, a behavioral scientist at the RAND corporation who is also a naturopath . The second author is Beth L. Poindexter, also a naturopath, with no other publications cited in PubMed. Claudia Witt is a physician who holds multiple academic positions in complementary medicine and alternative medicine. She has numerous publications in her CV including studies of homeopathy for chronic illness . The final author is Dr. David Eisenberg, a medical doctor who is a proponent of CAM and naturopathy in particular . None of this disqualifies the authors or their economic analysis of CAM. However, it does raise concerns about the potential for bias to be present in the analysis. \n The review attempts to identify all published economic evaluations of CAM, (which they call CIM, for complementary and integrative medicine). The authors point out that CAM is (not surprisingly) not funded by insurance plans: \n In not being part of conventional medicine, individual complementary therapies and emerging models of integrative medicine (ie, coordinated access to both conventional and complementary care)\u2014collectively termed as complementary and integrative medicine (CIM)\u2014are often excluded in financial mechanisms commonly available for conventional medicine, 2 and are rarely included in the range of options considered in the formation of healthcare policy. The availability of economic data could improve the consideration and appropriate inclusion of CIM in strategies to lower overall healthcare costs. In addition, economic outcomes are relevant to the licensure and scope of practice of practitioners, industry investment decisions (eg, the business case for integrative medicine), consumers and future research efforts (ie, through identifying decision-critical parameters for additional research 10 ). \n This is a textbook example of begging the question , assuming that CAM is being excluded from strategies to lower healthcare costs, without explaining why these treatments are not considered \u201cconventional medicine,\u201d and without demonstrating that these treatments actually lower overall healthcare costs. So the authors stated objective is to catalog the economic evidence that does exist. \n The authors admit (and I agree) that search strategies for CAM in the published medical literature are difficult. It\u2019s complicated in part by the industry\u2019s decision to keep redefining itself \u2014 so what was labelled \u201calternative\u201d is now \u201cintegrated\u201d or \u201ccollaborative\u201d. They exclude all treatments considered to be \u201cstandard treatment\u201d or \u201cdelivered by conventionally credentialed medical personnel\u201d. That is, they attempt to identify treatments which are either not proven to work, or proven not to work. The net result is 204 papers published between 2001 through 2010. The reviews span the CAM spectrum : \n \n 45 were manipulative therapies (e.g., chiropractic) for a range of conditions \n 41 were acupuncture treatments \n 38 were studies of \u201cnatural\u201d products \n 27 were for forms of \u201cmind-body\u201d medicine \n 24 were for homeopathy \n 18 were for general CAM interventions \n 25 were for other CAM therapies, including \u201caromatherapy, healing touch, Tai Chi, Alexander technique, spa therapy, music therapy, electrodermal screening, clinical holistic medicine, naturopathic medicine, anthroposophic medicine, water-only fasting, Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease, use of a corset and use of a traditional mental health practitioner.\u201d \n \n Unfortunately, in no part of the analysis is the veracity of the underlying clinical data questioned. The authors applied different economic analysis quality checklists, narrowing the list to 31 studies deemed \u201chigh quality\u201d . And here\u2019s where the weakness of the underlying evidence is made clear. There appear few if any papers based on studies that actually blinded patients. Many are studying the \u201cadjunctive\u201d or add-on addition of CAM such as acupuncture to usual care, and concluding that interventions are either cost-saving or offer good value for money. Some of the studies included are economic models only \u2014 not based on actual data collected in trials, but utilizing simulated models to estimate costs and effects. And some of the studies deemed CAM don\u2019t appear to be CAM at all- one paper estimates cost-effectiveness of a clinical trial that would evaluate vitamin K1 versus alendronate for fracture prevention: neither an evaluation of CAM nor an evaluation of its underlying cost-effectiveness. Another models outlines the cost-savings of Tai Chi programs in a nursing home population, based on the premise that tai chi demonstrably reduces the risk of falls. Looking at the manipulative treatments, some were delivered by chiropractors, and others by physiotherapists or general practitioners. Given the variety of treatments and approaches included in the final list, it\u2019s not possible to draw any conclusions about the individual or overall effectiveness of CAM. But that doesn\u2019t stop the authors from trying: \n There are several implications of this study for policy makers, clinicians and future researchers. First, there is a large and growing literature of quality economic evaluations in CIM. However, although indexing is improving in databases, finding these studies can require going beyond simple CIM-related search terms. Second, the results of the higher-quality studies indicate a number of highly cost-effective, and even cost saving, CIM therapies. Almost 30% of the 56 cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit comparisons shown in table 4 (18% of the CUA comparisons) were cost saving. Compare this to 9% of 1433 CUA comparisons found to be cost saving in a large review of economic evaluations across all medicine. \n Here the authors make a direct comparison between CAM and conventional medicine, implying that CAM may save more than medicine \u2014 a comparison that can\u2019t be substantiated based on the multiple weaknesses in the results that report. Contrast their finding with that of White and Ernst, in their 2000 systematic review of CAM economic analyses , make a more cautious and pragmatic conclusion about the economic attractiveness of CAM: \n Spinal manipulative therapy for back pain may offer cost savings to society, but it does not save money for the purchaser. There is a paucity of rigorous studies that could provide conclusive evidence of differences in costs and outcomes between other complementary therapies and orthodox medicine. The evidence from methodologically flawed studies is contradicted by more rigorous studies, and there is a need for high quality investigations of the costs and benefits of complementary medicine. \n White and Ernst\u2019s conclusion is equally relevant to the current systematic review. When it comes to evaluating cost-effectiveness, we first need to establish that a treatment is actually effective. Without this, there\u2019s no point in proceeding to looking at costs. The authors mention this indirectly \u2014 but not to determine if these interventions actually work, but to validate the results (and seemingly the conclusions) that have already been drawn about their effectiveness: \n Given the substantial number of economic evaluations of CIM found in this comprehensive review, even though it can always be said that more studies are needed, what is actually needed are better-quality studies\u2014both in terms of better study quality (to increase the validity of the results for its targeted population and setting) and better transferability (to increase the usefulness of these results to other decision makers in other settings). \n Conclusion \n The highest quality evidence, and most rigorous clinical trials, have failed to identify complementary and alternative medicine interventions that offer meaningful clinical benefits. Lower quality trials are more likely to report positive findings, and economic analyses based on these studies should be expected to be biased towards findings of cost-effectiveness. Economic analyses that conclude treatments are cost effective are more likely to be published. The result is an economic house of cards. Given the variety of treatments, models and endpoints, systematic reviews are not useful tools to evaluate the overall cost-effectiveness of a disparate group of treatments. However, they may be useful in summarizing the types of studies that exist. Given the results of this systematic review, there is good evidence to suggest that economic analyses of CAM interventions do not generate useful or accurate estimates of cost-effectiveness. \n \n Reference \n Herman, P.M., Poindexter, B.L., Witt, C.M. & Eisenberg, D.M.

Infection rates vary wildly from country to country, with Swaziland having the highest rate at 25.9%. Gambia is below average, at 2% or 18 thousand people, but still has a serious HIV problem, and now finds themselves at the center of the HIV controversy in Africa. \n This epidemic has been magnified by unfortunate realities on the ground. Africa has an insufficient public health and medical infrastructure to deal with the massive challenge such an epidemic presents. This has led the World Health Organization to contemplate partnering with local traditional healers , to make them into an extension of the effort to bring modern medical treatment to the HIV-infected in Africa. This desperate strategy is fraught with problems, not the least of which is that most traditional healers have had no prior contact with science-based medicine. \n Former South African president Thabo Mbeki seriously set back his country\u2019s HIV efforts by embracing crank HIV denial. Coupled with his denialism was efforts by Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang to use traditional medicines to treat HIV/AIDS. This combination resulted in restrictions on the distribution of anti-retoviral drugs in South Africa that is estimated to have cost hundreds of thousands of lives. \n Tshabalala appealed to local tradition over science and evidence, and in fact resisted attempts to scientifically study her beet-root and other \u201cnatural\u201d remedies. She argued that treatment with traditional methods should not get \u201cbogged down in clinical trials\u201d and criticized attempts to impose \u201cWestern science\u201d on African methods. \n Joining the ranks of leaders contributing to, rather than ameliorating, the HIV epidemic in Africa is Gambian President Yahya Jammeh . He is promoting the traditional medicine approach, adding his own cult of personality angle. He claims to have invented a secret formula of boiled herbs. In a state television address he said: \n \u201cJust as the Prophet Mohammed prevailed and established Islam (\u2026)I also prevailed to cure HIV/AIDS to the point that 68 are being discharged today,\u201d \n \u201cWho am I to expect that everybody would praise me.\u201d \n His herbal treatment also requires that patient stop their anti-retroviral therapy \u2013 which has garnered criticism from the WHO. Jammeh\u2019s treatment is also more than just herbs. It has a healthy dollop of religion as well : \n The treatment involves several herbal cream applied and consumed over a number of weeks and prayer from the Qur\u2019an. His patients have to renounce alcohol, tea, coffee, theft and sex for the duration of their treatment. \n He is also quoted as saying: \n \u201cThose who said that HIV/AIDS is not curable may be right because if you don\u2019t know God and you believe that you descended from frog and you are not created by the Almighty Allah or you came to this world through evolution then you would not know that anything that happens in this world good or bad, Allah knows about it and has solutions about it. There is no disease that the Almighty Allah doesn\u2019t know about and there is no disease without a cure.\u201d \n This all may seem strange and even primitive, but it is not fundamentally different from any form of faith healing in the West, or even most forms of co-called alternative medicine. The psychological elements are all the same. Treatments often involve avoiding alleged toxins or unhealthy foods or activities, and require a certain amount of faith \u2013 if not overtly religious, then in the human energy field, meridians, or magical homeopathic energies. \n We also see the mislabeling of magical faith-based treatments as \u201ctraditional\u201d in order to make them more palatable. Finally, despite frequent claims that alternative treatments are \u201ccomplementary\u201d to science-based medicine rather than a replacement for it, they are frequently a replacement for science-based therapies. \n Once you reject rigorous science-based standards as the basis for modern medicine, then there is no practical or philosophical difference between whatever \u201calternative\u201d treatment you offer in its place and the dangerous herbal witchcraft of Jammeh. The only difference between homeopathy, acupuncture, healing touch and Jammeh\u2019s herbs is subjective and cultural."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/more-hiv-nonsense-in-africa/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.jollofnews.com/": 1, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 2, "http://ca.yahoo.com/": 1, "http://www.avert.org/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["The American Academy of Family Physicians journal American Family Physician (AFP) has a feature called Journal Club that I\u2019ve mentioned before . \u00a0Three physicians examine a published article, critique it, discuss whether to believe it or not, and put it into perspective. In the September 15 issue \u00a0 the journal club analyzed an article\u00a0that critiqued the process for developing clinical practice guidelines . It discussed how two reputable organizations, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) looked at the same evidence on lipid screening in children and came to completely different conclusions and recommendations. \n The AAP recommends testing children ages 2-10 for hyperlipidemia if they have risk factors for cardiovascular disease or a positive family history. The USPSTF determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening. How can a doctor decide which recommendation to follow? \n What Are Clinical Practice Guidelines? \n They are \u201ccookbooks\u201d developed for the convenience of doctors in practice. A group of experts asks a practical question (for instance, should we screen the general population for prostate cancer with a PSA test?) and does the dirty work, plowing through mountains of evidence so when a doctor in practice asks that question, a handy science-based answer will be available to him. There is a National Guideline Clearing House \u00a0that has compiled 2476 of these guidelines, with as many as 20 guidelines on a single topic. They don\u2019t provide any oversight of quality or of how the guidelines were developed. In general, guidelines from specialty groups tend to be methodologically less sound and to recommend a more aggressive strategy than guidelines from primary care organizations. I recently wrote about prostate cancer screening, where most groups now recommend against routine PSA testing but urologists strongly disagree. \u00a0Another problem is that published guidelines are not always current; they must be updated as new evidence comes in. \n Comparison of the USPSTF and AAP Guideline Development Process \n Why did the USPSTF and the AAP disagree? This table offers some clues: \n \n \n \n Standard  \n USPSTF  \n AAP  \n \n \n \n \n Clear description of methods used to identify and analyze scientific data \n Yes \n No \n \n \n Method of updated literature review that is referenced and outlined \n Yes \n No \n \n \n Standard process for appraisal and grading the quality or sufficiency of the evidence \n Yes \n No \n \n \n Conflicts of interest rigorously vetted \n Yes \n No \n \n \n External peer and public review \n Yes \n No \n \n \n \n The Journal Club participants felt the USPSTF process was \u201cbest in class,\u201d and they chose to follow the more rigorous, more conservative, USPSTF recommendation over the AAP recommendation for childhood lipid screening. \n Problems with the Process \n All too often, there is no good clear-cut evidence to answer the question, so guidelines fall back on consensus recommendations from a group of experts. A review of American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines found that only 11% were based on multiple randomized trials or meta-analyses, and nearly half were based only on experts expressing their opinions. \u00a0Also, 56% of guidelines had an author who disclosed a conflict of interest. \u00a0Worse yet, 87% of guidelines had ties to the pharmaceutical industry. \n In one documented case , a prominent nonprofit organization received $11 million dollars from a pharmaceutical company and then placed 6 members with ties to that company on a 9-person committee charged with determining the role of the company\u2019s drug in a guideline. \n Another problem is lack of transparency. Published guidelines seem to imply unanimity, but individual committee members may have disagreed. It would be helpful to know whether the vote was 9-0 or 5-4. And why. \n Improving the Process \n The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has proposed these 8 standards: \n \n Complete transparency \n Conflict-of-interest disclosure \n Multidisciplinary member composition \n Systematic literature review meeting IOM standards \n Clear and consistent rating and description of evidence \n Recommendations articulated in detail and in a standard form \n External review by the full spectrum of stakeholders \n Appropriate updating of guidelines \n \n There is no requirement to follow these standards, and no way to enforce them. The American Cancer Society has said it will follow them. The WHO has also proposed its own rigorous 19-step process. \n Conclusion \n The Journal Club analysis concludes with a summary of key points, including: \n \n There are no controlled trials demonstrating that lipid screening in children improves long-term health outcomes. \n The level of evidence of clinical practice guidelines should be reviewed before widespread implementation. \n \n I would add:\u00a0Clinical practice guidelines are very useful and the USPSTF guidelines are the most trustworthy."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/clinical-practice-guidelines-cholesterol-tests-for-children/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.aafp.org/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 6, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 2, "http://guideline.gov/": 1, "http://www.iom.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["As I mentioned recently, as hard as it is to believe, this blog is rapidly approaching the end of its fifth year of existence. Our first post was delivered to the anxiously waiting world on January 1, 2008; so thus upcoming January 1 will represent our fifth anniversary. In the blogging world, that\u2019s almost the equivalent of a fiftieth anniversary, given how fast most blogs turn over. Something that is even more satisfying than mere longevity is that we really have found a niche in the medical blogosphere to the point where we\u2019ve become quite influential. People notice us. Our targets notice it when we discuss them. Sometimes even the press notices us. This is all a very good thing. \n Unfortunately, even though we\u2019ve been at this for just shy of five years, there are still topics we haven\u2019t covered, or at least haven\u2019t covered in sufficient depth. The topic of my post today is one of the latter topics. We\u2019ve mentioned it before; we\u2019ve alluded to it before (for instance when discussing the antivaccine website Medical Voices and the Ayn Rand-worshiping Association of American Physicians and Surgeons ; but there hasn\u2019t been a post dedicated to this particular topic. I find this particularly odd because it was one a piece of misinformation promoted by elements of the antivaccine movement that truly shocked and disgusted me. Before I learned of this particular myth, I was surprised to learn that there are really people who think that vaccines are dangerous and cause autism, but I viewed it as being of a piece of a lot of other quackery I was discovering at the time. \n Way back in the day, when I first encountered antivaccine views in that wretched Usenet swamp of pseudoscience, antiscience, and quackery known as misc.health.alternative (m.h.a.), there was one particular antivaccine lie that disturbed me more than just about any other. As I mentioned, it wasn\u2019t the claim that vaccines cause autism, which is more or less the central dogma of the antivaccine movement. Even ten years ago, before the series of studies that have been released since then that fail to find a hint of a whiff of causation between vaccines and autism, that wasn\u2019t a particularly difficult myth to refute. Indeed, given newer studies, refuting that myth has only gotten easier over the years. Emblematic of how far into the depths that particular myth has been pummeled, I know it\u2019s gotten pretty easy when even the mainstream media start to accept that the claim that vaccines cause autism is a myth and report matter-of-factly on issues such as Andrew Wakefield\u2019s fraud and don\u2019t give nearly as much copious and prominent media time to the likes of Jenny McCarthy. Let\u2019s just put it this way. When the hosts of a \u201cmorning zoo\u201d-type radio show in Salt Lake City pummel the latest antivaccine celebrity to make a fool of himself, Rob Schneider , you know that, from an informational standpoint at least, the tide appears to have turned from several years ago, when the media took this myth a lot more seriously. That\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t still have a problem. After all, \u201cphilosophical\u201d exemption rates are going up based on a lot of this sort of misinformation, but at least the media are less insistent on \u201ctelling both sides\u201d of a science story that doesn\u2019t really have two sides. \n \nNo, what I\u2019ve found to be one of the most disturbing antivaccine claims of all is the assertion that shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a \u201cmisdiagnosis for vaccine injury.\u201d SBS is the name originally given to a triad of findings consisting of subdural hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy. More recently, because the syndrome is more complex than the original description suggested, these days the syndrome is more properly referred to as non-accidental head injury or abusive head trauma . This particularly vile antivaccine lie has popped up again with a story I recently became aware of , that of Amanda Sadwosky, whose father Elwood Sadowsky is currently in prison for killing her and whose mother Tonya Sadowsky is trying to win him a new trial and thereby free him by claiming, in addition to a bunch of contradictory and dubious arguments, that vaccine injury was a major cause of Amanda\u2019s death. She even maintains a web page she calls the Amanda Truth Project , which reminds me very much of the case that first showed me just how low antivaccine activists can go. Let\u2019s go back in time more than a decade and examine the case of Alan Yurko. Then we\u2019ll fast forward and compare it to the case of Amanda Sadowsky. Finally, we\u2019ll wrap things up by discussing why this particular \u201ctheory\u201d (more like wild speculation) is so scientifically and intellectually bankrupt. \n Free Alan Yurko \n I first learned of the vile concept that somehow SBS when I learned of the case of Alan Yurko . Yurko gained \u201cfame\u201d (if you can call it that) when he was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1999 for the murder of his 10-week-old son, who was shaken to death. Somehow, Yurko became the centerpiece of a campaign ( Free Yurko ) that featured as the centerpiece of its argument for Yurko\u2019s innocence the claim that shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is in realty \u201cvaccine injury.\u201d Unfortunately, ultimately Yurko was released early, not because the courts agreed with the lie that it was vaccine injury, not SBS, that killed Yurko\u2019s son. Rather, it was because apparently the coroner\u2019s office where the autopsy was done on the dead baby was, as Australian skeptic Peter Bowditch put it, the most shoddily run morgue ever and incompetent coroner ever . \n If you ever wanted to know how low antivaccine zealots can sink, let Bowditch describe it : \n \n I want you to think about a dead baby. This baby was ten weeks old when he died. The autopsy revealed bleeding around the brain, in the eyes and in the spinal column. There were bruises on the sides of his head. Another thing that the autopsy showed was four broken ribs. These fractures had started to heal, and therefore indicated a pattern of physical abuse prior to the date of death. The father admitted to holding the baby by his feet and hitting him shortly before he died. I now want to you to form an opinion of the father. If you are the sort of person who opposes vaccination, you would see this man as a hero. You would see him as a martyr to the cause and would try to get him released from prison. In a breathtaking demonstration of what it can mean to believe that the end justifies the means, the anti-vaccination liars have adopted Alan Yurko as a symbol that they can use to frighten parents into refusing vaccination for their children. You can read a loathsome justification for this murderer at http://www.woodmed.com/ShakenBabyAlan.htm . \n Alan Yurko\u2019s story is basically as follows. A month before the death of Alan Ream, the baby Yurko was convicted of killing, Alan Yurko was in jail for aggravated burglary. He was paroled and then somehow managed to get away with violating that parole by moving to florida with his girlfriend and her infant son. Not long after the couple arrived in Florida, Alan Ream was rushed to the hospital with massive head injuries, including a subdural hematoma. The baby died from his injuries. Not surprisingly, given his previous convictions and propensity for violence, suspicion rapidly fell on Yurko, the baby\u2019s stepfather, after investigation revealed the baby\u2019s pattern of injuries to be consistent with SBS. Yurko was tried and convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison plus ten years . \n It was at this point that somehow the antivaccine movement latched on to the Yurko case, turning him into a martyr for the cause. Why they would do this, I have no idea. If you\u2019re looking for scientific credibility to persuade people to believe your contention that vaccines cause autism, I can\u2019t think of a worse way to achieve that credibility than to defend a baby killer using pure pseudoscience and outright nonsense. But, then, I\u2019m not an antivaccinationist. Apparently to some elements of the antivaccine movement, it seemed like a good idea at the time (and, sadly, still does to some of the same people today). Basically, these people set up the Free Yurko webpage and a Free Yurko mailing list. Prison officials, judges, and doctors were bombarded with letters arguing that Yurko was innocent of killing his child. The group assisted with Yurko\u2019s appeal, basing it on conspiracy theories and antivaccine pseudoscience. An old \u201cfriend\u201d that I\u2019ve written about before in the context of the death of HIV/AIDS denialist Christine Maggiore\u2019s daughter Eliza Jane Scovill provided a long report on Alan\u2019s death that was every bit as much a stinking turd as the report he provided to try to \u201cprove\u201d that Eliza Jane didn\u2019t die of AIDS. \n Yes, I\u2019m referring to Mohammed Ali Al-Bayati, PhD, DABT, DABVT, who runs a company known as Toxi-Health International . Basically, Dr. Al-Bayati is not a physician and therefore not a human pathologist; rather, he has a PhD in comparative pathology and is apparently also a toxicologist. Perusing his website leads me to believe that Dr. Al-Bayati specializes in churning out reports for the defense that basically say whatever the defense wants them to say. One particularly despicable area of subspecialization that he appears to engage in is\u2014you guessed it\u2014blaming cases of SBS on vaccine injury combined with a whole host of other medical conditions that he plucked about his nether regions, much the way he did the same when he tried to claim that a girl with HIV in her brain and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia didn\u2019t die of HIV encephalitis and her pneumonia but rather died of\u2014I kid you not\u2014an allergic reaction to amoxicillin . \n In the case of Alan Ream, Dr. Al-Bayati tried to blame the infant\u2019s death on a whole host of factors besides the obvious (trauma), including reactions to vaccines administered two weeks before Alan was rushed to the hospital, where, if you believe Dr. Al-Bayati, Alan was killed by a combination of vaccine injury, massive infection, and overdose of sodium bicarbonate, and an overdose of heparin, as well as from complications due to Francine Ream\u2019s (his mother\u2019s) oligohydramnios, gestational diabetes, anemia, loss of appetite, spastic colon, urinary tract and vaginal bacterial infections, and hemorrhoids, as well as Alan\u2019s five week premature birth. Al-Bayati also tried to tie Alan\u2019s neonatal jaundice to his death four months later and even dismissed a healing rib fracture as having occurred during Alan\u2019s birth and somehow having been missed by the medical staff. Of course, there\u2019s one glaring problem, namely that Alan developed respiratory distress syndrome after birth; I\u2019d be shocked if there weren\u2019t multiple chest X-rays taken during his initial hospitalization after birth. Basically, it\u2019s a veritable Gish Gallop of cherry picked bits of Alan\u2019s clinical history. These bits were then thrown against the wall to see if any of it would stick\u2014very much like Al-Bayati\u2019s report on Eliza Jane Scovill. \n It should be noted that Yurko did have grounds for a new trial, but not because there was any credibility to the notion that SBS is a misdiagnosis for vaccine injury. I was rather because of some very shoddy work by the medical examiner who apparently had a history of carelessness. The errors were not directly related to the diagnosis of SBS but were pretty bad nonetheless. For instance, there were typographical errors, such as referring to the child as African American when he was Caucasian and commenting on organs that couldn\u2019t be there because they were donated after the baby was declared brain dead. The judge ruled that these screwups warranted a new trial, after which Yurko\u2019s defense team reached a deal with the prosecution. Yurko pled no contest to manslaughter and was sentenced to time served, six years and 125 days. It didn\u2019t take long for Yurko to wind up back in jail again. He was picked up for a parole violation in his aggravated burglary charge and will be in prison until 2014. \n Yurko was the prototype for a defense against SBS that fused antivaccine conspiracy mongering with copious pseudoscience to try to exonerate parents and caregivers accused of SBS. Indeed, if you peruse Toxi-Health\u2019s website, you\u2019ll see many examples. Al-Bayati appears to do a lot of this sort of work, with several reports trying to prove that babies thought to have died due to SBS were in fact killed by something else. Many of them were published in that antivaccine bastion Medical Veritas, and all of them follow what I like to call the \u201cGish gallop\u201d method of argument, generally blaming a combination of various medical problems and vitamin deficiencies \u00b1 vaccines (usually plus vaccines) as the \u201creal cause\u201d of death. Then, \u201cluminaries\u201d such as Harold Buttram (who is also known for claiming that childhood vaccines can result in genetic hybridization from alien human and alien animal DNA contents and is a regular contributor to the antivaccine blog International Medical Council on Vaccination ); Veira Scheibner , F. Edward Yazbak , and Michael Innis took up the cause. Then, an Ayn Rand-loving crank medical organization, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS). Indeed, a former president of the AAPS, Jane M. Orient, even wrote a sympathetic portrayal of Alan Yurko right in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons (JPANDS), the official journal of the AAPS. To see how many contortions are necessary to blame vaccines, just check out what Dr. Orient writes: \n One possible mechanism of a vaccine reaction is vitamin C depletion, which can occur in a variety of conditions including acute illness, strenuous exertion, or catabolic conditions. Ascorbate depletion is accompanied by elevated blood histamine levels and increased capillary fragility. \n Her citation to support this statement? An article in the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine . Not exactly a reliable source. \n The death of Amanda Sadowsky \n Last week, I came across a story that, although it\u2019s a couple of months old and I somehow missed it, is disturbingly familiar : \n \nJust a few years ago Tonya and Elwood Sadowsky believed that life could not get any better after Tonya gave birth to a beautiful baby girl Amanda. For the first time ever the couple were happier than they ever thought possible. Sadly, their happiness was cut short when aged just four months old Amanda died unexpectedly. Elwood was immediately arrested and charged for his daughter\u2019s murder because he was caring for his daughter at the time she was taken ill. \n Amazingly, in June 2007, without ever having a trial, Elwood Sadowsky was jailed for life for Shaken Baby Syndrome. According to wife Tonya, Elwood was forced into taking a guilty plea a few days before the trial was due to have started. He was threatened by the prosecution and emotionally blackmailed by his own lawyers. This was due to the fact that his lawyers did not know how to defend him! Tonya says: \n \u201cThey literally didn\u2019t know anything about \u2018Shaken Baby Syndrome\u2019 and believed the doctors\u2019 diagnosis which was: homicidal blunt force trauma.\u201d\n \n And: \n \nAmanda died from multiple skull fractures and the triad of injuries associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) which are Retinal haemorrhages (bleeding into the linings of the eyes); subdural haemorrhages (bleeding beneath the dural membrane); Encephalopathy (damage to the brain affecting function).\n \n Anyone familiar with the case of Alan Yurko can see where this is going, and that is indeed exactly where it went. The next part of Tonya\u2019s story consists of a citation of one John D. Lloyd, Ph.D., M.Erg.S., CPE, CBIS , who seems to have some legitimacy in that he has some peer-reviewed publications, eighteen on PubMed . None of them, as far as I can tell, are related to SBS. He does, however, appear on a directory of expert witnesses , which suggests to me that part of his \u201cprofessional activity\u201d is to testify on behalf of whoever pays him. None of that means he\u2019s a bad guy or not a decent scientist, but when it comes to SBS, I do find it rather odd that he has several publications on other topics related to ergonomics and brain injury but nothing other than abstracts listed as submitted to various conferences on his CV . Let\u2019s put it this way. Although it\u2019s not uncommon for people to list publications they have \u201cin preparation\u201d or \u201csubmitted\u201d to journals, I\u2019ve never seen a CV listing abstracts submitted to conferences. Why? Because abstracts are the lowest form of scientific publication. I could easily whip off a list of abstracts submitted to various conferences, having submitted the abstracts. I might even get them accepted, too, because the bar for acceptance for abstracts is much lower than it is for getting a manuscript published in a peer-reviewed journal. Indeed, some conferences basically accept every abstract submitted for at least a poster presentation, barring obvious problems with them. I also find it rather curious that Dr. Lloyd doesn\u2019t actually mention which conference he\u2019s submitted his three abstracts to. \n Now, I realize that we don\u2019t know everything there is to know about SBS. Nor do I normally have a problem with research that questions the prevailing hypothesis, if the research is well done. However, when I see someone like Dr. Lloyd argue against the concept of SBS and lend aid and comfort to a defense team that is using the claim that vaccines are the cause of SBS, then I have a problem: \n Examining the timeline of this case an extremely important fact emerges. It is obvious to even the untrained eye that this baby suffered adverse reactions after each vaccination. Her first possible reaction was noted within 24 hours of the Hepatitis B vaccine which she received at birth. Tonya said: \n \u201cWhen she got the Hep B, I wasn\u2019t told. She was wheeled into my room SCREAMING her full head off, thrust into my arms with the comment, \u201cShe\u2019s upsetting the other (inmates) babies in the nursery\u201d. \n \u201cShe was jaundiced by the next day.\u201d \n In his report Dr Buttram wrote: \n \u201cOn the next day, Feb. 17th, according to mother\u2019s notes, Amanda was brought in to her from the nursery screaming, as \u201cshe was bothering the other babies in the nursery,\u201d suggestive of an encephalalitic reaction to the hepatitis B vaccine, something rarely recognized for its true nature.\u201d \n Leading to this speculation: \n \nDid Amanda suffer from this reaction and was this the reason that baby Amanda was so distressed? If so the injuries found just weeks later may have been caused by the Hepatitis B vaccine, however, this possibility this was never investigated.\n \n Perhaps it wasn\u2019t investigated because the contention that the Hepatitis B vaccine caused multiple skull fractures, much less the injury pattern consistent with traumatic injuries of the sort caused by shaking and trauma seen in abusive head trauma is ridiculous on its very face. Does Dr. Lloyd really want to hitch his wagon to a group that tries to argue that vaccines can somehow cause fractures, retinal hemorrhages, and the like? Those must be some magical vaccines! I know, I know, Elwood admits that he dropped Amanda, but in general his story as described in this article doesn\u2019t add up. Dr. Lloyd\u2019s argument seems to be somewhat contradictory as well. He points out that falls from as low as two and a half feet can produce fatal head injuries, but then claims that it\u2019s not possible to shake a baby hard enough to cause the constellation of injuries seen in SBS. He bases his argument on a series of studies that he\u2019s carried out, including a comparison of shaking with activities of daily living (in which he argues that the head angular acceleration of a baby playing in a Jumparoo is similar to what can be achieved by an adult shaking a baby\u2014I kid you not); a study claiming that vigorous shaking can only be maintained for 20 seconds before adults become exhausted ; and a bit of a straw man argument that retinal hemorrhages are \u201cno longer generally accepted by medical doctors to be caused by vigorous shaking of an infant\u201d (no one ever said that retinal hemorrhages alone were necessary for the diagnosis of SBS). Unfortunately, he uses a rather simplistic model that has been found to be wanting; indeed, their results tend to be contrary to the pathological evidence. (Dr. Lloyd even concludes this in one of his studies.) More complex models are now state of the art. SBS is a difficult entity to model, because the primary injury tends to be what is known as diffuse axonal injury or shearing . Basically, the axons (the protruberances from neurons that carry the nerve impulses) can, with repeated strong acceleration and deceleration, shear. Such injuries are often much more severe than they appear on imaging studies. \n The defense builds on that argument by claiming that Elwood suffered from a condition that caused him to black out and pass out periodically (which, if true, tells me that he should never be carrying a baby alone). Perhaps the most ludicrous is another defense claim that somehow the use of oxytocin to induce Tonya\u2019s labor resulted in brain damage in Amanda of the sort seen in the postmortem. Taken as a whole, the defense case sounds a lot like Alan Yurko\u2019s defense: Throw out all sorts of pseudoscientific and quacky nonsense and see if any of it sticks. He dropped the baby! But he has a disease that causes him to black out. But the baby was \u201cvaccine-injured\u201d and her mom\u2019s labor was induced with oxytocin, which caused brain injury! It\u2019s an \u201ceverything but the kitchen sink\u201d defense that sounds very much like Yurko\u2019s Gish gallop and even involves some of the same people, as you will see. This sort of defense takes advantage of the controversies around SBS and how the triad originally described as pathognomonic of SBS can be mimicked by other conditions (one of which, I might add, is not vaccine injury). \n Where you will see these other people, besides seeing Harold Buttram in the news article above, Amanda\u2019s mother, Tonya Sadowski, has gone so far as to publish a website, Amanda Truth Project . Before I delve into that website, let me just say: I understand. Mrs. Sadowski lost her baby. She doesn\u2019t think her husband did it, at least not intentionally. She might even have a valid argument; it\u2019s hard to know, although Elwood Sadowski does have a criminal background not unlike that of Alan Yurko. Be that as it may, and no matter how much sympathy I might have for her, Tonya Sadowski is doing great harm by using the Alan Yurko defense (\u201cvaccines and other nasty stuff done it\u201d). You\u2019ll see what I mean if you peruse the reports on her website prepared by Michael Innis and Harold Buttram . They\u2019re recycling the same sorts of arguments used to try to get Alan Yurko off. \n Unfortunately, there are things there like this CT scan report from the hospital to which Amanda was first taken ( Fairview Hospital ), which found: \n \n Bilateral temporoparietal and right occipital skull fractures. \n Hemorrhage is seen adjacent to the falx, in the dependent portions of the occipital horns, and in a subtle area of parenchymal hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe. \n There is an area of decreased attenuation in the left posterior parietal region compatible with a remote injury and focal encephalomalacia. \n \n Note that Amanda presented to Fairview Hospital in full arrest, was resuscitated, and then was flown to Rainbow Babies & Children\u2019s Hospital in Cleveland, where from Buttram\u2019s report it is not clear whether the following represent a new head CT or an interpretation of the head CT done at Fairview: \n \nMultiple skull fractures. Bilateral cephalhematoma. intraparenchymal, subdural, subarachnoid, and intraventricular hemorrhage. \n Diffuse loss of sulci and cisterns as well as gray-white differentiation consistent with global edema. Downward herniation cannot be excluded.\n \n This is some major trauma. It is not subtle. The most likely explanation for such massive trauma is, well, trauma. What do Buttram and Innis claim? Dr. Innis claims : \n \nI conclude that Amanda suffered from undiagnosed Neonatal Hepatitis as shown by the abnormal Liver function Tests and as a consequence developed Vitamin K Deficiency Disease which caused her death. An Adverse Vaccine Reaction resulting in a fall in the level of Vitamin C cannot be excluded.\n \n Which is a common theme among conspiracy theorists who think that SBS is in reality some combination of vaccine injury and nutritional deficiencies. Buttram, in particular, likes the idea that vitamin C deficiency is a cause of SBS and that vitamin C deficiency is caused by\u2014you guessed it!\u2014 vaccines : \n Returning to the importance of vitamin C in relation to vaccines, one of the prime roles of vitamin C in the body is its action as an antioxidant in donating electrons to quench free-radical and inflammatory damage from toxins and/or infections, with our consideration here being vaccine toxins. In the process of donating electrons, vitamin C necessarily becomes depleted. Once the level is reduced to the point that it can no longer protect the brain, which is unduly susceptible to toxic and infectious damage, it (the brain) may become subject to free-radical damage. \n This is, of course, utter nonsense. It\u2019s also utter nonsense that vaccines commonly cause encephalopathy so severe that it can be mistaken for SBS/abusive head trauma. With this as a way of background, it\u2019s not surprising that Buttram does what he does best in his report for the Sadowskis. He Gish gallops . It\u2019s vitamin K deficiency that caused bleeding! It\u2019s a vaccine reaction! It\u2019s rickets making the baby\u2019s bones brittle! It\u2019s birth trauma! It\u2019s liver dysfunction! It\u2019s nutrient deficiencies caused by Amanda\u2019s mother having been given ampicillin: \n The mother did attempt breast-feedings supplemented with formula but ultimately abandoned breast feedings, primarily because of the infant\u2019s difficulty in sucking. Under normal circumstances, breast-feeding establishes a prevalence of highly beneficial and protective Lactobacillus bifidis in the infant\u2019s intestinal flora, but the mother was administered 2 grams of ampicillin intravenously during her labor with Amanda, which would have largely eliminated the L. bifidis. This in turn would have opened the way for yeast infestations, later manifesting as cradle cap, \u201cyeasty\u201d neck folds, and intestinal yeast overgrowth, the true source of the intractable colic and reflux problems. These in turn in all likelihood would have led to unrecognized nutrient mineral and vitamin deficiencies including calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins A, C, and D. \n The ridiculousness of this claim speaks for itself. Such are the sorts of arguments used by antivaccinationists who have drunk the Kool Aid that vaccines somehow contribute to a syndrome that is frequently mistaken for SBS/abusive head trauma. I don\u2019t know if Elwood Sadowski really did kill his daughter. Maybe he did fall accidentally while carrying her, resulting in fatal injuries. I suppose it\u2019s possible (although the story given is not convincing). However it happened, Tonya Sadowski\u2019s grief at the death of her daughter does not excuse her abuse of science and embrace of the worst kind of antivaccine pseudoscience in order to exonerate her husband. \n One last claim. \n Finally, I can\u2019t help but point out one last favored distortion that antivaccinationists use to argue that vaccines cause SBS/abusive head trauma. I learned of this particular canard several months ago, when I came across an article by someone named Catherine Frompovich on the Orwellian-named International Medical Council on Vaccination (formerly Medical Voices ) with the even more Orwellian-named subtext \u201ccritical thinking for a critical dilemma\u201d entitled Bone Density Test Can Disprove Shaken Baby Syndrome . Frompovich starts out by touting her antivaccine cred by kissing up to\u2014who else?\u2014Harold Buttram: \n Before I delve into the topic I want to discuss, perhaps you may want to know that I have co-authored several papers with Dr. Harold E. Buttram, MD, regarding topics such as Brain Inflammation, Basics of the Human Immune System Prior to Vaccines, and Shaken Baby Syndrome, which can be accessed at the International Medical Council on Vaccination website starting with Vaccines and Brain Inflammation at http://lawreview.byu.edu/articles/1325789487_13Seeley.FIN.pdf . In order to access the other papers, you will have to scroll through IMCV\u2019s archives. Dr. Buttram\u2019s name appears first on all articles. \n Frompovich\u2019s credulity, which leads her to suck up to Buttram, also leads her to exult over a paper published in a law journal by someone named Matthew B. Seeley entitled Unexplained Fractures in Infants and Child Abuse: The Case for Requiring Bone-Density Testing Before Convicting Caretakers . The basic thrust of the article is that not all cases of unexplained fractures in infants are due to abuse. In other words, it\u2019s rather a massive straw man argument. Here\u2019s why. First, unexplained long bone fractures are not pathognomonic for child abuse. What\u2019s far more suspicious are injuries that are not consistent with the history given. Second, as I mentioned earlier, the term SBS is falling out of favor; the preferred term is now \u201cabusive head trauma,\u201d which doesn\u2019t limit the potential cause of injury to shaking. Third, recent reviews have been very clear in emphasizing that the diagnosis of abusive head trauma is not a trivial matter and can be at times difficult. Indeed, they emphasize other conditions that can cause the usual triad (subdural haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage and encephalopathy) that characterize the diagnosis. A review from just last year, for example, provides what it characterizes as the \u201cexhaustive\u201d list of conditions that can result in this triad: \n \n Chronic subdural haemorrhage \n Accidental falls \n Resuscitated SIDS \n Cortical vein and sinus thrombosis \n Inflicted injury \n Vitamin D deficiency \n Second impact syndrome (a second head injury, often very mild, occurring days or weeks after a first) \n Aneurysm rupture \n Rare genetic conditions \n \n Notice that none of the conditions listed above includes \u201cvaccine injury.\u201d There is no evidence that vaccine injury can cause the triad associated with SBS/abusive head trauma. Indeed, this particular review is also notable for its emphasizing a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach to diagnosing SBS/abusive head trauma. Another review describes the process of diagnosing SBS/abusive head trauma: \n SBS is known to be difficult to detect and diagnose. Clinicians should use their own clinical judgment as each individual case is different and needs to be considered carefully on its own evidence\u2026The diagnosis of SBS must be considered in any infant or young child who collapses with no obvious causes. Clinicians must maintain a low threshold of suspicion for considering this diagnosis.16 The diagnosis of SBS is usually made following a careful medical and social history taking. This ought to be supplemented by appropriate investigations. \n The authors conclude that the clinical diagnosis is usually based on a patient history that does not explain the clinical features and list the laboratory investigations that should be undertaken. \n The paper that Frompovich touts advocates the use of single photon absorptiometers to measure bone density in children. While this might well be a valid tool to estimate bone density in infants, but this argument does not in any way support the idea promoted by antivaccine loons that the SBS/abusive head injury triad can be caused by vaccines. In fact, Frompovich even admits that Seeley would likely \u201cbristle at the thought that vaccines can contribute to SBS.\u201d I have no idea what Seeley would think. For one thing, he\u2019s not a pediatrician, and he published no primary studies on this issue, nor is he a neuroscientist. Rather, he is an exercise scientist wrote a medical-legal review that is basically designed to suggest to other lawyers what sorts of techniques can be used to sow reasonable doubt in a jury considering cases of child abuse of babies who present with the SBS triad, and, quite frankly, I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s pandering to a law audience or being incredibly simplistic when he argues that there\u2019s a huge degree of doubt because it\u2019s impossible to do a randomized trial to determine whether shaking can cause the SBS triad. \n I kid you not. That\u2019s really what he writes, which is one reason why I was underwhelmed. Frompovich, not surprisingly, eats this up, so much so that she starts advocating subjecting children to bone density tests as routinely as Apgar scores and, in a triumph of speculation over evidence, suggests that the birth dose of hepatitis B vacine should not be given before a serum vitamin D test is done. In essence, Frompovich\u2019s invocation of Seeley\u2019s review article is designed to sow fear and doubt about the very existence of SBS and then to imply, not so subtly, that if SBS is difficult to diagnose then it could well be vaccine injury. Never mind that, again, there is no credible evidence that SBS is in any way related to vaccine injury, and never mind further that the intricacies and controversies in diagnosing SBS do not in any way demonstrate that vaccines cause the triad of findings that characterize SBS. By publishing this sort of nonsense, the IMCV has demonstrated that there are no depths to which it would not go in trying to discredit vaccines. \n The bottom line is that the claim that SBS is in reality due to \u201cvaccine injury\u201d ignores the wealth of clinical data indicating that SBS (now more frequently and formally referred to as \u201cabusive head trauma\u201d) is a distinct clinical entity that has been well-studied and is probably underdiagnosed . Although there is controversy over the pathophysiology of SBS, how much force is necessary to produce it (hence the additional term to describe it), whether it\u2019s underdiagnosed, what clinical entities can be confused with SBS, and whether it\u2019s sometimes over-prosecuted, there is no controversy that SBS is not \u201cvaccine injury.\u201d When antivaccinationists insist that it is, they abuse science, reason, and morality by by proving themselves willing to use such a myth to exonerate baby killers. They also demonstrate that they are about hatred of vaccines, not clarifying the science and evidence behind abusive head trauma, SBS, or whatever the entity might be called in the future."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-antivaccine-lie-that-just-wont-die-shaken-baby-syndrome-is-really-due-to-vaccine-injury/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/": 2, "http://my.clevelandclinic.org/": 1, "http://web.archive.org/": 2, "http://www.theamandatruthproject.com/": 5, "http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/": 1, "http://kidshealth.org/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 3, "http://rationalwiki.org/": 1, "http://lifesciences.byu.edu/": 1, "http://www.uhhospitals.org/": 1, "http://www.actamedicaportuguesa.com/": 1, "http://www.sciencedirect.com/": 1, "http://www.nejm.org/": 1, "http://www.jpands.org/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.ratbags.com/": 3, "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/": 7, "http://www.drergonomics.com": 1, "http://lawreview.byu.edu/": 2, "http://skepchick.org/": 1, "http://www.toxi-health.com": 1, "http://americanloons.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.jbiomech.com/": 1, "http://www.theamandatruthproject.com": 2, "http://www.drergonomics.com/": 4, "http://www.nvic.org/": 1, "http://www.weeklyblitz.net/": 2, "http://www.springerlink.com/": 1, "http://www.toxi-health.com/": 1, "http://scienceblogs.com/": 3, "http://dontshake.org/": 1, "http://www.whale.to/": 1, "http://www.bizland.com": 1, "http://www.jurispro.com/": 1, "http://www.bizland.com/": 4}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["David Gorski recently pointed out that Science Based Medicine is going on five years. Amazing. That there would be so much to write about day after day comes as a surprise to me. Somehow I vaguely thought that \u2018controversies\u2019 would be resolved. Pick a SCAM, contrast the SCAM with reality as best we understand it, and, once the SCAM was found wanting, it would be abandoned. Why would rational, thoughtful people persist in the pursuit of irrational behavior, contradicted by the universe? \n Ha. More the fool me. I would never have guessed that these SCAMs are harder to kill than Dracula (at least one version of Dracula ). Stake them and back they come*. \n I have tried to avoid repeating repeating information found in prior posts by myself and others, in part because I am lazy and in part because, well, I have said it before. Just look it up. I have come to realize (all too slowly) that each blog entry should be \u00a0self contained and that much of the old material is lost in the corn maze (an punning homophone) that is WordPress.\u00a0Reading my second favorite computer reinforces the realization that each post often needs to be an island universe, complete in itself. \n Medicine is difficult. At least I find it difficult. You have to first come up with a cause of the symptoms, understand the underlying physiology and then try and determine the best course of therapy. I have it easy in Infectious Diseases, a much more binary specialty. Patients are either infected or not, I have a therapy or not and I either cure them or not. Not a lot of wiggle room in the treatment of, say endocarditis or pneumonia, and very little in the way of bias and placebo to obfuscate the therapy. Or so I would think. \n Much of the rest of medicine is not as clear cut. As a physician there are multiple ways to assess the potential efficacy of a therapy. One is a definitive randomized placebo controlled trial. Those do not seem to occur as often this decade as in prior times when giants walked the earth. Or so my faulty memory suggests. \n Another way is to try and master the literature, a futile endeavor. In two areas of medicine I have more than passing knowledge: Infectious Diseases and SCAM\u2019s. The nice thing about having a breadth and depth of reading is you can understand where new articles fit into an overall picture. What was the patient population studied, what were the weaknesses of the study, how applicable is the information to other populations? The downside of such expertise is I have to rely on the kindness of strangers in other areas of medicine, since I know next to nothing. \n The breadth of knowledge has also made sources of information that I once trusted much more suspect. Popular media? No way. Newspapers and magazines so often get it wrong in areas of my expertise that I no longer trust them in areas where I know nothing (just about everything else). \n Meta-analysis? Nope. Talk about disillusion. I used to rely on meta-analysis, but they are worse than laws and sausages, ceasing to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made . I still like the meta-analysis and systemic reviews as a nice overview of a clinical topic, but, for reasons we will see, I am hesitant to draw any therapeutic conclusions from any meta-analysis. \n And the worst source is an anecdote. If I have said it once, I have said it once, the three most dangerous words in medicine are \u201cin my experience.\u201d I had always though of it in the context of physicians deciding on a therapeutic intervention, not so much from the patients perspective. I realized that for patients that is often the primary way they\u00a0deciding\u00a0to try a therapy, especially a SCAM therapy. \n What would you do if you were a highly intelligent intellectual at one of the top newspapers and were curious about acupuncture? With the research capacity of, say, the Chicago Sun Times , you could get the skinny on any topic, right? Or instead, you could ask you readers if you should get acupuncture. Sigh. A microcosm of why, compared to SBM bloggers, Sisyphus \u00a0had it easy. \n That method of seeking medical advice has been around since 480 AC as mentioned by Herodotos: \n \u2018They had a very practical habit: on the marketplace passer-by\u2019s give \nadvice to the patient about their ailment, in which case they can sometimes\u00a0rely on personal experience or take advantage of someone else who suffered\u00a0from the same symptoms. Nobody can just pass by without saying anything. It\u00a0is obligatory to ask the patient what ails him. They bury their corpses in\u00a0honey and mourn in the same way as in Egypt.\u2019 (Thanks to Cees Renckens for the quote). \n The more things change, the more they stay the same. Except for the honey part. \n Everything I distrust about medical reporting seems, of late, to have found a home in the Atlantic. \u00a0Check out the\u00a0headline: Biological Implausibility Aside, Acupuncture Works \u00a0 by\u00a0Lindsay Abrams. \n Really? News to me. I tend towrds the opinion that if a process is biologically impossible, then it is more likely that a) any positive results are likely to be spurious and due to bias and b) if bias is removed, \u00a0the old double blind placebo controlled trial, then most effects will fade to zero. \n It often appears that journals and magazines do not even bother to read their own reports. A scant two years ago the Atlantic reported on the work of John Ioannidis and why most of the medical literature is suspect \n \u201cMuch of what medical researchers conclude in their studies is misleading, exaggerated, or flat-out wrong. So why are doctors\u2014to a striking extent\u2014still drawing upon misinformation in their everyday practice?\u201d \n and that in clinical trials \n \u201cthe range of errors being committed was astonishing: from what questions researchers posed, to how they set up the studies, to which patients they recruited for the studies, to which measurements they took, to how they analyzed the data, to how they presented their results, to how particular studies came to be published in medical journals. \n This array suggested a bigger, underlying dysfunction, and Ioannidis thought he knew what it was. \u201cThe studies were biased,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes they were overtly biased. Sometimes it was difficult to see the bias, but it was there.\u201d \u201c \n One of the epiphanies of my understanding in how to approach the medical literature was when I discovered the works of Dr. Ioannidis . It would appear that Lindsay Abrams didn\u2019t read the article about Dr. Ioannidis. More likely it was read and ignored. All the issues raised about the validity of the results of medical research never seem to translate into SCAM studies. \n What was this earth shattering, high quality clinical paper that demonstrated after decades of lousy research that acupuncture works? Finally a large randomized placebo controlled clinical trial with good endpoints that demonstrates efficacy? Certainly all the prior trials that meet those criteria demonstrate acupuncture doesn\u2019t work and that acupuncture is no better than placebo. \n Readers of my entries know that my\u00a0assessment\u00a0of placebo: it does not alter \u00a0pathophysiology, just the perception of pain and disease, and then only a wee, clinically irrelevant, amount. I agree with the article that acupuncture is \u201cnothing more than fancy ways of invoking the placebo.\u201d And you know Crislip\u2019s law: acupuncture effect = placebo and placebo effect = nothing, therefore the acupuncture effect = nothing. \n I well know that interacting with a patient with a therapeutic intervention will alter the patients perception of what is occurring without altering the underlying pathophysiology. As the\u00a0 NEJM study \u00a0revealed, if patients think they are receiving a therapy even when they are not, they will report their asthma is better even when the objective tests show no improvement. To my mind the placebo effect is no different than kissing a child\u2019s boo-boo: it is subjectively beneficial although no objective changes occur to the boo-boo. \u00a0These human interactions are an important, if ineffective, part of the human relationships. \n The Atlantic was referring to \n \u201cnew, large study out of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, cautiously suggests that there is indeed something more to acupuncture. A meta-analysis of 18,000 patients from 29 randomized controlled studies, it found that the treatment was more effective than controls in relieving back and neck pain, osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain. Significantly, it also found that real acupuncture was more effective than shams.\u201d \n Sigh. I see the word study, and I think oh good. Someone has done a clinical trial. Enrolled patients and compared, in a double blind manner, interventions\u00a0against\u00a0placebo. No. It is a meta-analysis. Calling a meta-analysis a study is not unlike a library declaring they acquired several dozen new books and magazines when their copy of Readers Digest arrives. Someone massaging preexisting data; hardly a study. \u00a0Nice for an overview of a topic, but worthless for drawing conclusions\u00a0definitive\u00a0conclusions. \n When applied to real treatments, those based on reality and known physiology, the results of meta-analysis are often not predictive of well done clinical trials : \n The outcomes of the 12 large randomized, controlled trials that we studied were not predicted accurately 35 percent of the time by the meta-analyses published previously on the same topics. \n Of course, that presupposes that the topic is not tooth fairy science. If the interaction is based on nonsense, then the validity of an intervention is likely to be less. My bias, clearly stated here, is that one should be able to be able to reason up and down the pathophysiologic pathways of disease and treatment on basic biologic plausibility and basic principals. \u00a0 It comes from being a truly holistic doctor, understanding infections at the level of amino acid substitution leading to drug resistance or disease susceptibility through to the interactions with the earths ecosystem. \n That meta-analyses are unreliable should not be surprising. Most reality based clinical trials are flawed, and if you collect a series of flawed studies, you end up with one big flaw. The idea behind the meta-analysis, collecting all the cow pies into one big pile and making gold, is only as good as the quality of the initial pies. It is rare to collect\u00a0Marie Callender\u2019s. \n I am not a true skeptic. I tend to avoid the words implausible and unlikely where I do not think they apply. As best can be determined, acupuncture, homeopathy, energy therapies, and a host of other SCAMs are, at the level of first principals, total bunk. And legitimate therapies cannot flow from pure bunk nor can a meta-analysis make pumpkin from cow. \n Prior meta-analyses of acupuncture suggest they are substandard. The perhaps ironic and self referential Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews of Acupuncture published 1996-2005 suggests \n \u201cSystematic reviews of acupuncture have overstated effectiveness by including studies likely to be biased. They provide no robust evidence that acupuncture works for any indication.\u201d \n And as the Wikipedia points out \n \u201cThe most severe weakness and abuse of meta-analysis often occurs when the person or persons doing the meta-analysis have an economic, social, or political agenda\u2026 If a meta-analysis is conducted by an individual or organization with a bias or predetermined desired outcome, it should be treated as highly suspect or having a high likelihood of being \u201cjunk science.\u201d From an integrity perspective, researchers with a bias should avoid meta-analysis and use a less abuse-prone (or independent) form of research. \u201c \n This is no small issue if you happen to be a practicing clinician who takes the health and wealth of your patients seriously. Do I trust a meta-analysis that suggests linezolid is better than vancomycin for the treatment of pneumonia when the studies and the meta-analysis are sponsored by the company? It doesn\u2019t completely abrogate the results of the trials, but it is well known that when the researcher has an axe to grind, the results will tend to sharpen the axe of the researcher . \u00a0All studies have bias, the question is how well they compensate. \u00a0I usually discount the results by about half when applied to the real world. \n When approaching any study where the end points are subjective and at the limits of perception, two archetype need to be considered. The first is the endless ability of people to fool themselves. \n At the turn of the last century a French Physicist, Blondlot, discovered N-rays . These rays were at the limit of detection and, like acupuncture, made no sense in the context of know reality. Multiple papers were published on N rays until a visiting professor, unknown to Blondlot, incapacitated the machine yet Blondlot still saw the N-rays. \n N-rays were a purely subjective phenomenon, with the scientists involved having recorded data that matched their expectations. \n Beware the N rays. \n The other archetype is clever Hans , the counting horse, who actually was reading the nonverbal cues from his owner to know when to stop counting. Humans are probably more sensitive and skilled than horses at reading nonverbal cues, leading to \n The observer-expectancy effect (also called the experimenter-expectancy effect,expectancy bias, observer effect, or experimenter effect) is a form of reactivity in which searcher\u2019s cognitive bias causes them to unconsciously influence the participants of an experiment. It is a significant threat to a study\u2019s internal validity, and is therefore typically controlled using a double-blind experimental design. \n Both N-rays and clever Hans are examples of the importance of blinding the researcher and the patient and why if blinding is not adequate then any results are suspect, especially if the end points are subjective. \n The studies of acupuncture that exclude N-ray and Clever Hans effects (i.e. really, really blinded) always show that acupuncture does nothing compared to fake acupuncture. \n The classic interpretation of clinical trials when an intervention, say mammary artery ligation is no better than a sham mammary artery ligation, then neither are effective. I have been in medicine a long time and that career is littered with interventions that were discovered to be no better than sham/placebo and (sometime slowly and reluctantly) abandoned by the medical profession. That, of course, has yet to happen with any of the SCAMs discussed on this blog. While no hospital still offers mammary artery ligation for angina, Centers of Integrative Medicine and their ilk become more common. \n So that is the background I use in approaching a clinical trial, a meta-analysis, and a paper on SCAMs. I admit I \u00a0have to read meta-analysis with Mr Gumby like understanding of the manipulation of the data, since statistics and I have never got along, despite my affinity for other forms of mathematics. \n So how does \u201c Acupuncture for Chronic Pain Individual Patient Data Meta-analysis \u201d stand up? \n Color me unimpressed. \n Done by Acupuncture Trialists\u2019 Collaboration. So no different than a meta-analysis by big pharma; they have a dog in the fight. That\u2019s ok, we all have a dog in the fight. But any result is likely inflated. \n After a search 31 of 82 trials met their criteria for inclusion. \u00a0Or they left out 51 trials, the validity of which I cannot say. \u00a0 Would any of that information changed the outcomes of the analysis? \u00a0I don\u2019t know;\u00a0I lack the time to look at all the primary data in preparation of this entry. \n They found that sham and real (as if there is a difference) acupuncutre were more effective than doing nothing.\u00a0I would expect that. The boo-boo is being tended too; there will be salubrious results. \n Did they remove the N-ray and Clever Hans bias? Nope. \n \u201chealth care providers obviously were aware of the treatment provided, and, as such, a certain degree of bias of our effect estimate for specific effects cannot be entirely ruled out.\u201d \n Right there you know that the results are mostly worthless: \n \u201cPutting their results into context, the authors of the study explain that for a pain rating of 60 on a 100-point scale, follow-up scores decreased to around 43 for those had received no treatment, 35 for those who had received fake treatment, and 30 for those who received acupuncture. This translates into a 50 percent reduction in pain for the acupuncture patients, and only 30 and 42.5 percent reductions for the control and placebo groups, respectively. \n It is impossible to measure pain objectively (Radiolab did a great piece on this last week), and the difference in pain reduction between sham and true acupuncture, though statistically significant, was small. But the authors\u2019 methodical elimination of biases, coupled with their massive sample size, give weight to their findings. \n The biases are there probably more enough to account for the results of real being better than sham acupuncure, the effect inconsequential clinically, and a massive sample size of cow pies only leads to one big cow pie indeed. \n Dr. Strawman then weighs in: \n Should the lack of biological plausibility lead us to reject compassion and empathy as a means to help improve our patients\u2019 health? \n How about \n Should the lack of biological plausibility lead us to reject a costly and worthless therapy with known complications and instead use our compassion and empathy in a manner that is not based on lies? \n The Fail blog needs to link to the Atlantic. It is a perfect match. \n That is not all that is new about acupuncture of late. The Cochrane reviews continues to prove they have no standards or they are really getting bored. They did a review of mumps treated with acupuncture. Really. They found one study. Honestly. They meta-analyzed\u00a0away: \n We could not reach any confident conclusions about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture based on one study. More high-quality research is needed. \n They had the same conclusion with insomnia \u00a0and endometriosis . \n Of course, pain, mumps, insomnia and endometriosis all have the same underlying pathophysiology, no wonder it \u2018works\u2019 for so many diseases.\u00a0Somehow \u00a0I don\u2019t think we need to do any research on using acupuncture to treat mumps, much less do a review. \n Not unsurpizingly when there is double blinding, analgesic effects disappears . This was an interesting study since they treated acute pain rather than chronic pain patients who \n gather a lot of information about different pain treatments and firmly believe in different therapies. \n They tested the ability of acupuncture, sham or real, to effect acute pain (cold and capsaicin). It didn\u2019t. While the real acupuncuture worked slightly better than sham for capsaisen-induced pain, the effect, like a Vickers results, \u201coccurred mainly in a rating range that seemed irrelevant to clinical pain.\u201d \n In another study in the same issue of Pain there is no difference between sham (random punctures), \u2018real\u2019 or placebo (fake punctures) acupuncture for low back pain, but all three are better than conventional therapy. The big flaw in the study is that they used hardened acupuncturists with a mean of 8.5 years of practice who were not blinded. While not statically different, real performed better than sham better than placebo, suggesting a clever Hans effect. \n Like the asthma study in the NEJM, the best one can conclude is that acupuncture is that it is another beer goggles of alternative medicine: it convinces the wearer the disease looks better than it actually is. \n * I am avoiding a Whack-a-mole metaphor."], "link": "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/i-never-meta-analysis-i-really-like/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nejm.org/": 1, "http://www.plosmedicine.org/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 6, "http://www.painjournalonline.com/": 2, "http://www.bmj.com/": 1, "http://blogs.suntimes.com/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 6, "http://rationalwiki.org/": 1, "http://en.wikiquote.org/": 1, "http://www.theatlantic.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 6}, "blogtitle": "Science-Based Medicine"}, {"content": ["Supporters of science-based medicine have expressed concern over this provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare,\u201d or the \u201cACA.\u201d): \n SEC. 2706. NON-DISCRIMINATION IN HEALTH CARE. \n (a) PROVIDERS.\u2014A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall not discriminate with respect to participation under the plan or coverage against any health care provider who is acting within the scope of that provider\u2019s license or certification under applicable State law. This section shall not require that a group health plan or health insurance issuer contract with any health care provider willing to abide by the terms and conditions for participation established by the plan or issuer. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a group health plan, a health insurance issuer, or the Secretary from establishing varying reimbursement rates based on quality or performance measures. \n Section 2706 (now codified as 42 U.S.C. Sec. 300gg-5) goes into effect in 2014 and covers virtually all individual and group insurance market policies, although it is not clear whether it will apply to existing policies \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in 2010 by the ACA. \n Section 2706 was not part of the U.S House of Representatives version of the ACA but was included in the Senate version (which ultimately passed) under the guidance of (surprise!) Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). It was heavily lobbied by the American Chiropractic Association and other \u201cCAM\u201d providers, as well as some \u201cconventional\u201d providers like nurse anesthetists and optometrists. The legislative history (reports, committee minutes, floor debates and the like which precede a vote on a bill) indicates it was specifically included to prevent discrimination against CAM providers.\u00a0\u00a0This is of obvious concern to anyone who supports science-based, or\u00a0for that matter evidence-based, medicine, as there is nothing to indicate that scientific plausibility or evidence (or the lack thereof) actually affects CAM practices. It should also concern insurers and those who pay for\u00a0insurance (employers and individuals) to the extent it might require payment for CAM\u00a0treatments, as ineffective treatments will negatively\u00a0affect their bottom line. The U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Labor and the Treasury Department, which are charged with issuing regulations implementing the ACA, have not yet promulgated regulations for Section 2706. The American Medical Association House of Delegates has already passed a resolution seeking its repeal. \n \n There is no discussion of exactly what this provision might mean or how it will be implemented in the legal literature, or, for that matter, any health care literature that I can find. On the web, CAM practitioners and proponents claim it will \u201cend discrimination\u201d against CAM by insurance companies, although I can find few examples of exactly how they think they\u2019ve been discriminated against. According to one chiropractic commentator , chiropractors have been excluded from coverage for spinal manipulation in some cases, or in others reimbursed at a lower rate than M.D.s, but that is all I could find in the way of specific examples. There is even less about exactly how CAM practitioners expect to benefit. While the American Association of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine and the American Association of Naturopaths welcomed the passage of Section 2706, they don\u2019t offer specifics as to how it might increase insurance coverage for their practices although I imagine they\u2019re busy figuring out the details, perhaps not in a way that\u2019s open for public viewing. \n To the extent CAM practitioners expect Section 2706 to increase insurance coverage for their services or increase reimbursement, yes that will likely happen to a certain extent. And of course the ACA greatly increases the number of insured people. But I don\u2019t expect it to be quite the boon they seem to be expecting. And here\u2019s why. \n Discrimination \n But first, a little legal tutorial. A central question in interpretation of Section 2607 is how the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d will be defined. It is undefined in the ACA or in any regulations (so far). Very broadly, to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d means to treat a person differently than others based on a group to which he belongs rather than on merit. \n In enacting regulations, I anticipate the federal agencies charged with promulgating them will look to the well-developed body of law of employment discrimination. First, there are some similarities between choosing workers to do a particular job and choosing health care providers to perform particular services. Second, it avoids having to completely reinvent the wheel. Third, it is an area with which one of the agencies involved, the Department of Labor, already has considerable expertise. Fourth, insurers, who are themselves large employers, are already familiar with compliance with the anti-discrimination laws. \n So let\u2019s have a very brief look at some basic principles of employment law to understand what \u201cdiscrimination\u201d might mean. Discrimination can be overt (\u201cI\u2019m not hiring you because I don\u2019t think women can be delivery drivers.\u201d) Or discrimination can be in the form of an employment practice that has a disparate impact on a particular group. (The ability to lift 75 pounds for a delivery driver position will have an adverse impact on the hiring of women.) However, criteria reasonably related to the requirements for a job are not discriminatory even if they have an adverse impact on a particular group. (The ability to lift 75 pounds is a legitimate criterion due to the fact that delivery drivers will regularly have to lift this amount of weight.) This includes education, training or a having a particular type of license or certificate as long as they are reasonably related to requirements of a particular job. (Having a commercial drivers license for the delivery driver position would be a permissible job requirement, because it\u2019s required by law, even though it would have a disparate impact on women because fewer women have this type of license.) \n Given the assumption that employment law principles will be incorporated into interpretation of Section 2706, what will be the effect of the \u201cNon-Discrimination in Health Care\u201d section of the ACA on CAM practices? At this point, we can\u2019t know, but here are some thoughts. \n Being a covered provider doesn\u2019t mean everything you provide is covered \n First, the ACA prescribes 10 broad areas of coverage that must be provided by (virtually) all insurance plans. These categories are: \n \n Ambulatory patient services \n Emergency services \n Hospitalization \n Maternity and newborn care \n Prescription drugs \n Rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices \n Laboratory services \n Preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management \n Pediatric services, including oral and vision care \n \n One notable feature of this list is that most of these categories aren\u2019t within an acupuncturist\u2019s or chiropractor\u2019s scope of practice. A greater number are within that of a naturopath, although scope of practice varies among the 16 states in which they are licensed. You can look forward to naturopaths making a huge effort to further expand their licensing because insurers can no longer exclude licensed naturopaths as a group from coverage. However, this cuts both ways. In order to get insurance companies out of the game, naturopaths have previously been able to exclude themselves from mandated coverage to get a naturopath licensing law passed. That is no longer an option. This will give insurance companies a reason to fight their licensing bills if insurers think naturopaths will drive up their costs. \n As explained in a previous post , instead of promulgating a defined set of benefits deemed \u201cessential\u201d for insurance coverage, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has punted to the states to choose a \u201cbenchmark\u201d plan from certain types of health plans sold in each state. On October 1st, states not making that choice automatically defaulted to a federal employee insurance plan as the benchmark. \n Nevertheless, federal regulations are being put into place which specifically define \u201cessential health benefits.\u201d This has already been completed for preventive services, which must be covered without any co-pay or having to meet a deductible. And what do they include? For all adults, services recommended by the\u00a0 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for prevention which have an evidence grade of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB.\u201d For children, it includes routine vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control as well as preventive care guidelines for children from the American Academy of Pediatrics. For women HHS apparently developed its own list. (All of the guidelines can be found here .) \n And is there a CAM diagnostic method or treatment among them? Nope. \n But, you may well ask, could some of these preventive services be provided by a CAM practitioner, even though they are science and evidence based? That is highly unlikely to happen for chiropractors and acupuncturists, despite chiropractors\u2019 claims otherwise or the alarming scope of practice\u00a0 granted to acupuncturists . \u00a0Many of the services (e.g., adult and childhood vaccinations) are simply not within their scope of practice. And while chiropractors may claim to offer some of the preventive services (e.g., obesity screening and counseling) most people are going to have these services provided by their primary care physicians. This is because the ACA requires everyone to select a primary care physician, which can be a pediatrician for children. (In addition, women are not required to get a referral for OB/GYN-provided preventative healthcare.) Why would anyone get obesity counseling from his chiropractor if he is already getting it from his PCP? And, if he does get it, I seriously doubt the insurer will pay for it twice. \n This does leave open the possibility that naturopaths could be designated as PCPs by patients in states where they are licensed to provide the full range of PCP services. However, if the naturopaths wish to be reimbursed for preventive services, they will have to stick to those mandated by the HHS. And any treatment will have to be covered by the insurer or the patient will have to pay for it out of pocket. For example, one covered preventive service is diabetes screening for adults. But that will not force insurers to cover non-EBM/SBM naturopathic practices like this, as described on the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians website: \n Patients [with diabetes] will be given various supplements, which are invaluable. They work synergistically with the other aspects of the comprehensive protocol to replace deficient nutrients; help lower their glucose levels and decrease their insulin resistance; reduce inflammation, lipids and blood pressure; and protect them from diabetic induced damage. Patients may at times need to continue on standard prescriptive medication, may need to start medications or commonly, due to naturopathic care, may be able to reduce or stop medications. The naturopathic physician will effectively monitor the need for medication and make appropriate suggestions about the need for their use. . . . Naturopathic treatment of diabetes can be incredibly effective and naturopathic physicians should be the first type of doctor a diabetic patient seeks out for long term care. \n Which brings me to this thought: now that everyone will have insurance coverage, I wonder how long it will take patients to figure out that, if they go to an M.D., D.O., or A.R.N.P as their PCP, their diagnosis and treatment is covered, but when they go to an N.D. as their PCP, not all of their diagnoses and treatments are covered. \n But I digress. \n Different treatment is not always discriminatory treatment \n Let\u2019s examine a few scenarios where the same therapy is provided by both a CAM practitioner and conventional practitioners. (All scenarios assume these practitioners are within the insurer\u2019s provider network.) \n Scenario 1: \n Three providers, a D.O., and physical therapist and a chiropractor, provide spinal manipulation for low back pain. Assuming an insurer covers spinal manipulation as a treatment for low back pain, will the insurer have to reimburse for it at the same rate, no matter who provides it? \n Yes, I think so. \n Scenario 2: \n Same facts, but a chiropractor manipulates the cervical spine, based on his \u201cdetection\u201d of a \u201csubluxation\u201d in the neck, which he thinks is causing the low back pain. \n No payment, because the insurer\u2019s not covering treatment based on diagnosis of a chiropractic subluxation is not \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against the D.C. Even though the chiropractor is being treated differently than the D.O. or the P.T. (charges for his spinal manipulation for back pain are not reimbursed) there is a reasonable, non-discriminatory reason for it (subluxation is not a valid diagnosis). \n Scenario 3: \n Same facts as 1. The insurer limits spinal manipulation for low back pain to a course of four treatments. The D.C. wants to perform a course of eight manipulations. \n Not reimbursing for the full course of eight treatments is not discrimination unless the D.C. can show the limitation to four treatments is a pretext for discrimination against chiropractors, who routinely prescribe more\u00a0manipulations for low back pain than D.O. or P.T.s. However, if the scientific evidence supports four treatments as the standard recommended therapy for acute back pain, the insurer has a reasonable, non-discriminatory reason for refusing coverage, thus there is no discrimination against the chiropractor. \n Scenario 4: \n Same facts as 1. Chiropractors seek higher reimbursement rates from insurers, claiming they have better education and training in performing spinal manipulation than P.T.s and therefore should be reimbursed at a higher rate. \n It would be a violation of the Act for insurers to raise rates for chiropractors but not P.T.s because current evidence does not support the conclusion that chiropractic manipulation is any more effective than that done by P.T.s. Under the Act, insurers can differentiate between providers giving the same treatments for the same condition only if quality or performance measures support that differentiation. \n I\u2019ll leave it at that with the hypotheticals with the warning that many more such factual situations will have to be resolved as the law is fleshed out. (Such as: What if a naturopath can provide some, but not all, preventive services? Will the insurance company have to reimburse her for those within her scope of practice, allowing the patient to split his preventive care between a naturopath and his M.D. PCP? What about a chiropractor who claims he practices \u201c pediatric chiropractic ?\u201d) \n Stay tuned \n I\u2019ll be following development of the ACA as it relates to CAM providers\u00a0 and report back to you.
