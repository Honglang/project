Cigarette smoke contains over 60 known carcinogens (Hech, 2003) and tobacco smoke is the main contributor to lung cancer (Biesalski et al., 1998) . Therefore, the tissues of those smokers with and without lung cancer provide great resources to study their gene expression changes and find out those lung cancer related genes to help corresponding treatment. \n To better understand the gene expression differences between smokers with and without lung cancer, researchers at the Third Medical Military University, China analyzed two related datasets from short read archive (Beane, 2011). \n They quantified the expression of human genes in these two samples of smokers with and without lung cancer. Differential expression analysis revealed a number of differentially expressed genes.

The Q3 orders bring its backlog to five systems. \n Additionally, the company is planning to launch new chemistry in the fourth quarter that it says will increase average read lengths to 5,000 bases with five percent of reads above 13,000 bases. PacBio\u2019s current C2 chemistry yields average reads of 3,000 bases with five percent above 8,000 bases. \n \u201cLong reads are especially valuable for de novo assembly applications and targeted sequencing of large repeat regions and regions with complex structural variation,\u201d CEO Mike Hunkapiller said during a conference call discussing the company\u2019s 2012 third-quarter earnings. \n Nevertheless, the company faced steep revenue declines this quarter \u2014 down 73 percent to $2.8 million from $10.5 million in the year-ago quarter and missing analysts average estimates of $3.1 million. \n The company did not recognize any revenue from sales of its PacBio RS sequencer during the quarter. It booked just one system in the previous quarter, which was still in the process of being installed in the third quarter, Hunkapiller said. \n He added that this was to be expected, as the company was not focused on booking instruments in the first half of the year, but that bookings should pick up in the second half of 2012. \n \u201cWe made progress on this goal in the third quarter with bookings for four new systems,\u201d Hunkapiller said, which the company attributes to \u201cthe progress we\u2019ve made in reliability and performance and focusing on making our customers successful.\u201d \n The company expects to recognize instrument revenue in the next quarter, as it installs some of the five systems currently in its backlog, Ben Gong, vice president of finance and treasurer, said during the call. \n Product Enhancements \n As the company said in previous earnings calls this year, it focused on the first half of the year on making improvements to the PacBio RS system. \n Hunkapiller said he is \u201cpleased\u201d with the progress the company has made on this front, noting that \u201csystem reliability has come a long way\u201d since the beginning of the year. Customers now have the C2 chemistry upgrade, which has significantly improved \u201csystem uptime,\u201d he said. \n Additionally, two products launched in recent months \u2014 the MagBead sample-loading station, which increases the number of long reads and lowers input requirements; and new software to detect base modifications \u2014 have made a big impact on instrument utilization, he added. \n Going forward, the company expects base modification analysis to be a key application of the PacBio RS. \n Last quarter, the company said it had developed new chemistry that it was testing in house ( IS 7/31/2012), and this week, Hunkapiller said that the new chemistry would be launched in the fourth quarter of this year. \n The chemistry increases average read lengths from 3,000 to 5,000 bases with the longest reads over 13,000 bases. \n The increase in read lengths and subsequent increases in throughput will enable new applications, Hunkapiller added. For example, he said the company has already received positive feedback from an early-access customer that is using the chemistry to sequence the rice genome, which is \u201creplete with repetitive elements and duplications.\u201d \n Happy Customers \n Another of the company\u2019s goals for 2012 was to focus on its existing customer base, betting that happy customers would drive adoption of the system ( IS 5/8/2012 ). \n The company recently held a user meeting that drew 78 attendees from 25 different customer sites, Hunkapiller said, citing two customer presentations that highlight the RS system\u2019s capabilities. \n In one project, researchers from the Center for Genomics Sciences at the Allegheny-Singer Research Institute sequenced and assembled bacterial strains from both human and plant pathogens, using only PacBio sequencing and the Celera assembler, Hunkapiller said. \n As part of a project for the US Department of Agriculture, the group sequenced and assembled 20 strains of a plant pathogen that causes diseases in more than 100 plant species, using four SMRT cells per genome. Additionally, the group just received funding from the National Institutes of Health for a project to sequence around 1,700 influenza strains in order to understand pathogen evolution. For this, the team will use three SMRT cells per genome. \n A second group, at the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine, has been using the RS to improve assembly of primate genomes, Hunkapiller said. The Baylor group is studying the genome of the sooty mangabey monkey, which is naturally resistant to AIDS, and comparing it to the macaque genome, which is extremely susceptible to the disease, in order to identify the genetic pathways associated with resistance and susceptibility. \n While a draft genome for the sooty mangabey exists, Hunkapiller said that the genome, which had been sequenced to 100-fold coverage using Illumina technology, contained 186,000 gaps and had an N50 contig size of 35,000 bases. \n Sequencing on the PacBio reduced the gaps by 65 percent and tripled the length of the contigs, he said. The Baylor team plans to publish the software that it used for the assembly in PLoS One , he added. \n Financials \n Product revenue was $1.3 million, down from $9.8 million in the year-ago quarter, while service and other revenue increased to $1.3 million from $535,000 in the comparable period of 2011. \n Net loss narrowed to $22.7 million from $29.2 million in the third quarter of 2011. \n R&D costs fell 37 percent to $12.6 million from $20 million, while SG&A spending declined 21 percent to $10.1 million from $12.8 million. \nLooking ahead, Gong said that he expects fourth-quarter revenues to \u201cincrease sequentially,\u201d with expenses remaining stable. Additionally, he said the company is targeting less than $20 million of cash use per quarter, so it should finish the year with around $100 million in cash, not including any additional capital the company may raise. \nAs of Sept. 30, 2012, cash and investments totaled $119.4 million. \n ( read more\u2026 ) \n ( Read the PacBio press release ) \n PacBio Books Four Systems in Q3 \u2013 Plans Q4 Chemistry Upgrade to Enable Longer Average Read Length is a post from: RNA-Seq Blog \n Incoming search terms: www rna-seqblog com pacbio-books-four-systems-in-q3-plans-q4-chemistry-upgrade-to-enable-longer-average-read-length"], "link": "http://www.rna-seqblog.com/news/pacbio-books-four-systems-in-q3-plans-q4-chemistry-upgrade-to-enable-longer-average-read-length/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.rna-seqblog.com/": 1, "http://www.genomeweb.com/": 3, "http://www.rna-seqblog.com": 1, "http://investor.pacificbiosciences.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "RNA-Seq Blog"}, {"content": ["Bioinformatician to join new Biomedical Sequencing Facility \u2013 Vienna, Austria \n from naturejobs.com \n We are looking for an experienced bioinformatician to join the new Biomedical Sequencing Facility at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Medical University of Vienna.

Currently available RNA-Seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. \n Now, researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY have developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously un-described RNA-Seq alignment algorithm which utilizes sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. \n They have used STAR to align their large (exceeding 80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-Seq dataset. \n STAR outperforms other aligners by more than a factor of 50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 Million 2x76bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full length RNA sequences. \n Implementation and Availability: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

The recent availability of high-throughput gene expression data for many related species has led to a burst of investigations into the genomic and evolutionary properties of sex-biased genes. In Drosophila, a number of studies have found that X chromosomes are deficient in male-biased genes (demasculinized) and enriched for female-biased genes (feminized), and that male-biased genes evolve faster than female-biased genes. However, studies have yielded vastly different conclusions regarding the numbers of sex-biased genes and forces shaping their evolution. \n Now, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have used RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, a species with a recently evolved X chromosome, to explore the evolution of sex-biased genes in Drosophila. \n \n They compared several independent metrics for classifying sex-biased genes and find that the overlap of genes identified by different metrics is small, particularly for female-biased genes. \n They investigated genome-wide expression patterns and uncovered evidence of demasculinization and feminization of both ancestral and new X chromosomes, demonstrating that gene content on sex chromosomes evolves rapidly. \n They examined the evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes and showed that male-biased genes evolve much faster than female-biased genes, which evolve at similar rates to unbiased genes. \n \n Analysis of gene expression among tissues revealed that this trend may be partially due to pleiotropic effects of female-biased genes, which limits their evolutionary potential. Thus, these findings illustrate the importance of accurately identifying sex-biased genes and provide insight into their evolutionary dynamics in Drosophila. \n \n Assis R, Zhou Q, Bachtrog D.

Understanding the mechanism and processes underlying fruit ripening would enable scientists to enhance the improvement of quality traits such as, flavor, texture, appearance and fruit sweetness. Although, the pineapple is an important fruit, there is insufficient transcriptomic or genomic information that is available in public databases. \n Now researchers at Universiti Malaysia Sabah have performed RNA-Seq of ripe yellow pineapple fruit flesh using Illumina RNA sequencing technology. About 4.7 million paired-end reads were generated and assembled using the Velvet de novo assembler. The assembly produced 28,728 unique transcripts with a mean length of approximately 200 bp. Sequence similarity search against non-redundant NCBI database identified a total of 16,932 unique transcripts (58.93%) with significant hits. Out of these, 15,507 unique transcripts were assigned to gene ontology terms. Functional annotation against Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database identified 13,598 unique transcripts (47.33%) which were mapped to 126 pathways. The assembly revealed many transcripts that were previously unknown. \n \n \n Ong WD, Voo LY, Kumar VS.
