The audience will be composed of industrial data mining practitioners, as well as academic researchers who are interested in designing algorithms to meet industrial needs. The workshop will foster the collaboration between academia and industry and speed-up the process for new techniques to transfer from academic research to industrial applications. \n The workshop focuses on applications of data mining in real-world projects. Topics include, but not limited to data mining applications in: \n\u2022 Finance \n\u2022 Retail \n\u2022 Insurance \n\u2022 Telecommunications \n\u2022 Crime & Homeland Security \n\u2022 Stock Market \n\u2022 Social Welfare \n\u2022 Social Media \n\u2022 Medicine and Health \n\u2022 Education \n\u2022 Sports \n\u2022 Transport \n\u2022 Education \n\u2022 Environment \n\u2022 Manufacturing \n\u2022 Government \n\u2022 Other Fields \n Long and Short Papers \nThere are two types of paper that can be submitted. One is a long paper covering research into real-world data mining applications in industry and government. The other is a short paper up to four pages from managers and practitioners covering a challenging and informative issue in data mining. This includes what the issue was, how it was managed and what lessons were learned from the activity. The page limit is 12 pages for long papers and 4 pages for short papers. All papers should be with 10pt font size, following the Springer LNCS/LNAI manuscript submission guidelines ( http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html ).

The package will provide various functionalities for data mining, with contributions from many R users. If you have developed or will implement any data mining algorithms in R, please participate in the project to make your work available to R users worldwide. \n Background \nAlthough there are many R packages for various data mining functionalities, there are many more new algorithms designed and published every year, without any R implementations for them. It is far beyond the capability of a single team, even several teams, to build packages for oncoming new data mining algorithms. On the other hand, many R users developed their own implementations of new data mining algorithms, but unfortunately, used for their own work only, without sharing with other R users. The reason could be that they donot know or donot have time to build packages to share their code, or they might think that it is not worth building a package with only one or two functions. \n Objective \nTo forester the development of data mining capability in R and facilitate sharing of data mining codes/functions/algorithms among R users, we started this project on R-Forge to collaboratively build an R package for data mining, with contributions from many R users, including ourselves. \n How it works \nThe project works in a way similar to an edited book. We, as organizors, send out call for participation and solicit R users to join this project and contribute their implemented functions and algorithms. The contributed functions will build up and make a package. \n Function authors will be responsible for the development, maintenance and documentation of their contributed functions. We will put all functions together as one package and also make a manual for the package. \n Function authors will be acknowledged as authors of corresponding functions in help documentation and manual of the package. We, as the organizor of the package, will be shown as the manager/maintainer of the whole package. \n It\u2019s free to join or quit the project at any time, and authors can withdraw their contributed functions at any time. \n Links \nThe RDataMining package and project: http://www.rdatamining.com/package \nThe RDataMining project on R-Forge:\u00a0 http://package.rdatamining.com or \n http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rdatamining/ \n Contact \nYanchang Zhao <yanchang at rdatamining.com> \n Join the RDataMining Project, and we will work together to build a comprehensive R package for data mining."], "link": "http://rdatamining.wordpress.com/2012/09/02/call-for-contribution-the-rdatamining-package-an-r-package-for-data-mining/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.rdatamining.com/": 2, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://r-forge.r-project.org/": 1, "http://package.rdatamining.com": 1}, "blogtitle": "blog.RDataMining.com"}, {"content": ["The Tenth Australasian Data Mining Conference (AusDM 2012) \nSydney, Australia \n5-7 December 2012 \n http://ausdm12.togaware.com/ \n Deadline extended to 31 August 2012 \n The Australasian Data Mining Conference has established itself as the premier \nAustralasian meeting for both practitioners and researchers in data mining. \nSince AusDM\u201902 the conference has showcased research in data mining, \nproviding a forum for presenting and discussing the latest research and \ndevelopments.
