You typically see digital signage in shopping malls and fast food restaurants, however college campuses are starting to use it as well. Digital signage is a great way to convey information quickly and in an eye catching manner. This infographic highlights how colleges are integrating digital signage into their campuses. \n Next up, we take a look at the logistics of voting. Most of us think of voting as a simple task, you go to your designated voting place, cast your vote and you\u2019re done. However, there is more that goes into election day than you see. This infographic takes you behind the scenes of election day and what really goes on after the last vote has been cast. \n Then we look at a guide to patient loyalty. We all have to go to the Doctor or hospital from time to time, and yes, it is a usually an unsettling experience. However, sometimes the worst part can be the billing process. Statistics show that patients that were satisfied with the billing process are twice as likely to return to that hospital than patients who were less than satisfied. So hospitals need to make sure their billing department is taking care of their patients as best as possible or their patients might not come back or refer new patients. This infographic highlights the importance of patient loyalty in growing your healthcare business. \n Next we will look at counseling careers. If you are considering a career in counseling then you know there are multiple fields that you can work in, it all really depends on the type of people you want to help, as well as work environment, job outlook and salary. This infographic highlights the four main fields of counseling. \n Lastly, we get to party. Okay, not really. We are going to look at how to party. You think you\u2019ve got it down pat but you could be wrong. This infographic will tell you all you need to know about how to party the right way. \n 1 \u2013 The Big Screen on Campus \n  \n Digital Signage Big Screen on Campus [Infographic] \nCompliments of Digital Signage Today \n 2 \u2013 The Logistics of Voting \n  \nCourtesy of Click Software \n 3 \u2013 A Guide to Patient Loyalty \n  \nCourtesy of: Connance \n 4 \u2013 Which Counseling Career Path if Best for You? \n  \nImage compliments of Best Masters in Counseling \n 5 \u2013 How to Party \n  \nCourtesy of bestcollegesonline.org"], "link": "http://nowsourcing.com/2012/10/25/this-week-in-infographics-lets-vote-then-party/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://info.connance.com/": 2, "http://www.clicksoftware.com": 1, "http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com": 1, "http://www.bestmastersincounseling.com/": 1, "http://nowsourcing.com/blog": 1, "http://www.bestcollegesonline.org/": 2, "http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/blog": 2, "http://www.bestmastersincounseling.com": 1}, "blogtitle": "NowSourcing.Com"}, {"content": ["Courtesy of WordStream"], "link": "http://nowsourcing.com/2012/10/25/24-hours-in-the-google-economy/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://nowsourcing.com/blog": 1, "http://www.wordstream.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "NowSourcing.Com"}, {"content": ["I\u2019m sure you all know about Mildred, we\u2019ve talked about her before.

She is, in fact,\u00a0 not friendly and extremely\u00a0judgmental. She sits in her reception area guarding the three elevators that are mirrored, so even when your back is to her, you can still see her frowning at you between cryptoquotes.

I know, I know, but with the election just around the corner it only makes sense. This first infographic is about cybersecurity and how both candidates, Obama and Romney, feel about it. \n Next up, have you ever had a midlife crisis or witness someone else having one? They are pretty bad, but sometimes they are warranted. This infographic highlights how your career may be the culprit and how changing careers or getting a master\u2019s degree might be the answer to your midlife crisis. \n Then, we take a little journey called the social discovery. Social discovery is about creating serendipitous experiences, aided by science, to help us find people, products, and places to enjoy. \n Next, we jump back into politics, but focus on green energy. This infographic highlights two types of green energy; wind and solar, as well as the political views on both. \n Last, but not least, we look at an infographic that shows you how to know when to go to the ER. I know this seems like something everyone should know, but believe it or not, many people don\u2019t know what kind of ailment or injury really require emergency care. If you are one of those people, this infographic will help you greatly. \n 1 \u2013 Obama vs Romney on Cybersecurity \n  \n Infographic by Veracode Application Security \n 2 \u2013 Midlife Crisis & Worst College Degrees \n  \n Courtesy of: Graduate Degree Program \n 3 \u2013 Social Discovery \n  \n Created by Glimpse \u2013 Social Discovery Conference \n 4 \u2013 Green Energy and Politics in 2012 \n  \nSource: Green Energy and Politics in 2012 \n 5 \u2013 How to Know When to Go to the ER \n  \nSource: Top Nursing Programs"], "link": "http://nowsourcing.com/2012/10/18/this-week-in-infographics-more-politics-and-some-other-stuff/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://glimpseconf.com/": 1, "http://www.veracode.com/blog": 1, "http://glimpseconf.com": 1, "http://www.veracode.com/": 1, "http://graduatedegreeprogram.net/": 1, "http://www.top-nursing-programs.com/": 2, "http://www.greencareers.biz/": 2, "http://graduatedegreeprogram.net": 1}, "blogtitle": "NowSourcing.Com"}, {"content": ["Courtesy of graduatedegreeprogram.net"], "link": "http://nowsourcing.com/2012/10/18/midlife-crisis-and-worst-college-degrees/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://graduatedegreeprogram.net/": 1, "http://nowsourcing.com/blog": 1}, "blogtitle": "NowSourcing.Com"}, {"content": ["Courtesy of Veracode"], "link": "http://nowsourcing.com/2012/10/17/obama-vs-romney-on-cybersecurity/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://nowsourcing.com/blog": 1, "http://www.veracode.com/blog": 1}, "blogtitle": "NowSourcing.Com"}, {"content": ["This week we start off with politics. Now, now, don\u2019t stop reading just yet. This first infographic compares how Obama and Romney financed their education. With the 2012 Presidential election just weeks away, everyone is trying to learn as much as they can about both candidates, and this infographic will give you some insight into where they both went to school as well as how they paid for their education. \n Next up, we look at another comparative infographic. This one compares how social Android and iOS users are. If you own a smartphone, chances are you are privy to the popular social apps, but believe it or not, depending on your operating system, you might be part of a more social group. \n Then we take a look at an infographic that has a more serious tone.\u00a0There is nothing shameful if you are suffering from a form of depression, in fact many people are, with close to 20 million being diagnosed on a yearly basis in the United States alone. Your mental health needs to be taken seriously and learning what you can about\u00a0 depression facts, symptoms and myths \u00a0will help you understand that it can hit you at any age, no matter the gender or race, depression affects us all whether it is directly or indirectly. In this infographic you will see what you can do to help yourself and those around you who are suffering from depression. \n Lastly, we jump back into politics (I know, don\u2019t shoot me). This last infographic focuses more on religion in politics, particularly Mormonism, but also the faiths of other US Presidents. \n 1 \u2013 The Cost to Educate a President \n  \n By Degreejungle.com The Cost to Educate a President \n 2 \u2013 Who is More Social?

When you think of celebrities you usually think of money, lots of it. However, just like us normal folk, celebs aren\u2019t always smart with their money. And sometimes an ex-wife or not paying taxes can really take a chunk out of their hard earned millions. This infographic highlights the bankruptcy stories of nine famous musicians. \n Next up, we take a look at a comparison of a green lifestyle and a typical one. It seems like everyone is wanting to go \u201cgreen\u201d these days, but many are skeptical because of the cost. However, it turns out that going green is not as expensive as everyone thinks, and is actually cheaper than living a typical lifestyle. \n Lastly, we venture into the cloud. Cloud applications are becoming more and more popular, especially among businesses. They are convenient and a great way to store data without worrying about losing it, but before you go buying a cloud app, it\u2019s important to know what you are getting into.
