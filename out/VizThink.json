Questions also had to be presented in a non-verbal way, using marker and paper. Regardless of artistic skills, it soon became a session of trading markers back and forth, as a wordless visual conversation would develop on paper. \n The next part of the session was a demonstration of what happens when we are given visual information that doesn\u2019t match the expected meaning or runs contrary to verbal or written communication. This is called, \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d. \n Display signage, traffic and wayfinding signs, web sites navigation, and presentations given using Powerpoint or Keynote can all contain cognitive dissonance, as demonstrated in a series of on-screen examples. Sometimes mixed signals come when signs or symbols are used that are unique to a local culture, or where they have specific cultural meanings that differ from one place to another. \n  Todd Cherches demonstrates differences in contextual meaning by visual placement \n Digging a little more deeply into visual context that can cause mixed signals, examples wer given where placement of images, or their position within the canvas or visual field, can add subtext which may enhance or detract from the intended meaning. \n In a final exercise, everyone was paired off again, with one person describing a series of geometric images to their partner, who had to draw the shapes strictly from the verbal definitions with no visual clues. (See an example of the results to the right) \n The program concluded with simple guidelines to avoid cognitive dissonance when using visuals, including: \n 1) Visual and verbal messaging should be in harmony with each other. \n 2) Be aware of context and be strategic when using visuals. \n 3) Know your audience \u2013 know their visual language and visual culture. \n 4) Have clear reasons for the decisions made regarding visual design. \n 5) Ask \u201cWHY\u201d for using visuals, and for choosing the visuals used. \n 6) Be purposeful in the use of visuals. \n You can see additional sketch notes from the event at\u00a0 Visuals for Change by graphic facilitator Amanda Lyons, and more photos from the event at VizThink NYC\u2019s Meetup.com page. \n \n \n \n\n\n Liked this article?

The Origami community uses diagramming as their visual language.\u00a0There are symbols which represent different folds, movements, and stages in the process.\u00a0A master folder can read a diagram and understand the steps to build any kind of model such as a beetle. \n  \n \n Together we tried our hand at simultaneously folding our papers while drawing the diagram. It was a fun process where we really weren\u2019t able to jump ahead because we didn\u2019t know what we were aiming to create! Dan kept our goal a secret in order to help us stay on track. His experience has been that some of us impatient folks would start assuming folds and create\u00a0weird\u00a0snowflakes, notes for passing, or lame paper airplanes instead of the intended model\u2019s outcome: rabbits\u2026. In the end not knowing, was actually an important part of the process. This is a huge parallel to life. There are so many things that happen at work or in life where you can\u2019t control the entire situation, where you don\u2019t know all the pieces or all the perspectives but somehow you have to trust yourself and trust the process. \n \n \n Dan talked about how the community has evolved and master folders have taken the art to a new level. No longer can you simply fold a beetle, or else you will be asked which type of beetle you\u2019re aiming to create. As co-learners we are always challenging each other to do more and do better. What will you do better today? \n A huge shout out to Dan for providing a glimpse into what is an art form rich with history and sharing many connections to visual thinking. Origami takes visual thinking and puts it right in the palm of your hand and says, \u2018Fold that. I dare you. See what happens.\u2019 In the end, you might get to see something you had no idea was possible. \n \u00a0\u2014- \n Thanks to Amanda Lyons of Visuals for Change for this recap. \n Thanks to Dean Meyers for his awesome photography.

The answer may be found in the ancient art of Origami. \n Since the 8th century, Origami has not only been developed as an art form, but also a powerful discipline to help translate complex processes into simple instructions. And, it\u2019s pretty damn fun to do! \n Join\u00a0 VizThink NYC \u00a0for our 2012 kick-off event with guest presenter and Interaction Designer\u00a0 Daniel Stillman . In this fun, hands-on, interactive workshop, you\u2019ll learn the ancient art of Origami, and also explore a new visual language in Origami diagramming. We\u2019ll create some great models (fun in and of itself!) and leave with a set of our own hand-drawn diagrams \u2013 helping us become more effective visual thinkers and communicators. \n Please RSVP for this VizThink NYC event, and stay in the loop on future events by signing up here: \u00a0 http://www.meetup.com/VizThink-NYC/events/53001082/ \n\n\n Liked this article?
