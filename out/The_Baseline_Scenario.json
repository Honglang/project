No matter how you get your weather news\u2014local TV or radio, The Weather Channel, AccuWeather, whatever\u2014hurricane forecast information originally comes from the National Hurricane Center , which is part of the National Weather Service. The raw data come in part from the Hurricane Hunters, the pilots who fly planes into hurricanes, who are part of the Air Force Reserve and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The computer models that predict where hurricanes are going to strike are developed by the NHC. \n In August 2011, Simon and I were on vacation with our families in Southern Florida as Hurricane Irene was approaching the East Coast. Simon had the idea of using government weather services as the example to lead off chapter 4 of\u00a0 White House Burning , \u201cWhat Does the Federal Government Do?\u201d I like this example because almost everyone agrees that the federal government should be engaged in disaster prevention, disaster relief, and even weather forecasting. In 2005, Rick Santorum proposed a bill that would have prevented the National Weather Service from providing weather forecasts to the public\u2014but he insisted that the NWS should gather weather data and provide it to private companies so that they could make money off of it. (AccuWeather is based in Pennsylvania, Satorum\u2019s state, by the way.) \n There\u2019s a strong case to be made that hurricane research is one area where a small amount of taxpayer spending has had huge public benefits. That argument is made by Jeff Masters of Weather Underground. I was going to put it into\u00a0 White House Burning ,\u00a0but I didn\u2019t think one of his sources said what he wanted it to say. Still, as I discussed in a previous post , it is highly likely that more accurate forecasts have saved tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary evacuations for each large hurricane. \n What do Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan think about taxpayer-funded hurricane research? We don\u2019t know what Mitt Romney thinks because we don\u2019t know what he thinks about anything (wait . . . this month he\u2019s a moderate, so he\u2019s probably for it . . . but isn\u2019t he in favor of private sector innovation, so maybe he\u2019s against it . . . how does his head not explode?). But we know what Paul Ryan thinks about it because the House tried to cut Hurricane Hunter funding by 40 percent in 2011. Let\u2019s see what he has to say about that on the campaign trail. \n The bigger issue is that Romney-Ryan calls to cut government spending run into the problem that most government spending is on things that most people like, such as disaster forecasting and prevention. This is why they can\u2019t say in particular what programs they would cut, just like they can\u2019t say what tax deductions they would eliminate, because that would be obviously stupid or unpopular. Instead, when they open their mouths to talk about government spending, they want more of it, like Mitt Romney saying we need an even bigger navy. (By contrast, Robert Gates, a Republican defense secretary, thought that eleven aircraft carrier groups were more than enough in a world where no other country had more than one\u2014and that\u2019s already stretching the definition of aircraft carrier group.) \n Romney-Ryan is all about lower tax rates, more spending on things they like, and nothing (tax increases or spending cuts) that would actually make anyone worse off.

Companies whose CEOs have golden parachutes are more likely to get acquisition offers and are more likely to be acquired, presumably because their CEOs are les likely to contest takeovers. On the other hand, these companies tend to sell for lower acquisition premiums, again because their CEOs are more likely to be happy to be bought out. \n \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d Bebchuk writes. But the problem is that when you take a longer view, golden parachutes appear to be bad for shareholder value. Companies that adopt golden parachutes have lower risk-adjusted stock returns than their peers\u2014despite the fact that they are more likely to be acquired. Some other factor is outweighing the positive effect (for the stock price) of more frequent takeovers. \n Bebchuk proposes one explanation: Golden parachutes make being acquired relatively painless to CEOs. Therefore, they are less afraid of being acquired; and, therefore, they are less concerned about maximizing shareholder value in the first place. \n Here\u2019s another possibility: Companies are more likely to grant golden parachutes to their CEOs if they have: (a) CEOs who care more about maximizing their personal wealth than about their companies; (b) boards who are more concerned about doing favors for the CEO than about doing what\u2019s right for the company; or (c) both. Those are not the kinds of companies you want to be investing in, since they\u2019re likely to screw up all sorts of other things in addition to their executive compensation policies."], "link": "http://baselinescenario.com/2012/10/26/the-effects-of-golden-parachutes/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://ssrn.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Baseline Scenario"}, {"content": ["By Simon Johnson \n In Washington today, \u201cbipartisan\u201d is a loaded term. The traditional usage of bipartisan is an agreement across the usual political divide \u2013 sometimes a good idea and in many cases the only way to get things done. But a darker meaning applies all too frequently \u2013 a group in which the members, irrespective of party affiliation, are very close to special interests and work to advance an agenda that helps a few powerful people while hurting the rest of us. \n Financial deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s was pushed by both Democrats and Republicans. It reached its apogee when Alan Greenspan, a Republican, was chairman of the Federal Reserve and Robert Rubin, a Democrat, was Treasury secretary. Bill Clinton was president; Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House. \n This is probably why President Obama and Mitt Romney shied away this fall from the issue of who was responsible for the financial crisis that brought us the deep recession and slow recovery of the last five years. Both political parties share culpability for allowing parts of the financial sector to take excessive risk while financing themselves with a great deal of debt and relatively little equity. \n In this context, the new Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative of the Bipartisan Policy Center seems eerily familiar. \n The introductory white paper published last week reads like a sophisticated manifesto preparing us for another round of deregulation. We have come a long way since the 1990s \u2013 and most of it has been downhill. No reasonable person can now espouse the kind of views that Mr. Greenspan repeatedly laid out during his libertarian push to allow banks to become as big and as dangerous as they wished. (In our book, \u201c 13 Bankers ,\u201d James Kwak and I go through the historical record of deregulation \u2013 and Mr. Greenspan emerges as a central character.) Mr. Greenspan\u2019s bipartisan notion \u2013 that any financial-sector mess can be cleaned up easily and cheaply \u2013 is now completely exploded. \n Still, the new initiative, underwritten by the Heising-Simons Foundation, seems likely for three reasons to push strongly for the rollback of important parts of the Dodd-Frank legislation. \n First, the white paper frames the entire issue in a way that is incorrect \u2013 but highly informative about the attitudes at work: \u201cEvaluating financial regulatory reform requires consideration of the inevitable trade-off between market stability and the combination of innovation, risk-taking and growth\u201d (see Page 6). \n There is no such trade-off. Financial crises destroy growth \u2013 and for a long period of time. If you want to undermine American productivity, as well as the power and prestige of the United States, step back and allow the financial sector to go crazy again. In the last decade, the United States lost its stability and its growth. It\u2019s too bad the presidential candidates were not pressed on this point during the recent debates, and particularly on the cost of the crisis, estimated by Better Markets to be more than $12.8 trillion. \n Second, of the task force\u2019s 14 members , an overwhelming majority are very close to the industry\u2019s way of thinking. Six are lawyers whose practices \u2013 according to their biographies on the Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative\u2019s Web site \u2014 involve working with major financial-sector players. Two of them, Annette L. Nazareth and H. Rodgin Cohen, are among the most well-known advocates for Big Finance (see this profile of Ms. Nazareth from Bloomberg Businessweek). Another of these lawyers is John C. Dugan, comptroller of the currency from 2005 to 2010, head of an agency famous for being very friendly to the banks under its supervision. Mr. Dugan also features in \u201c13 Bankers\u201d \u2013 not as influential as Mr. Greenspan but still a person very much identified with deregulation and nonregulation. \n Another two task-force members are senior figures at companies \u2013 Oliver Wyman and PricewaterhouseCoopers \u2013 for which Wall Street firms are important clients. Robert K. Steel is also on board; he is currently a deputy mayor in New York City and was previously chief executive of Wachovia and worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years . Mark Olson, currently with Treliant Risk Advisors, is a past president of the American Bankers Association. \n Powerful people in the industry were, naturally, happy to have regulators back off and supervision to become super-light in the past. In fact, they lobbied long and hard to make this happen \u2013 including, for example, the right to use their own risk models in calculating how much equity capital they needed to have. I hear the same arguments today. \n With 10 of the 14 initiative members so close to big players in the financial sector, can this initiative in fact be \u201cindependent, objective and fact-based\u201d? Their clients do not want to be regulated effectively. \n Not everyone in this group should be considered close to big banks or Wall Street more generally. Three distinguished academicians are involved \u2013 John C. Coffee Jr. , James D. Cox and Thomas H. Jackson . We shall see to what extent they can provide a counterweight to the financial sector. There is also one independent member from outside the academic world, Eric Rodriguez , vice president at the National Council of La Raza, which the Bipartisan Policy Center describes as \u201cthe largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States.\u201d \n If the organizers of the initiative were seeking experienced industry professionals, they should have invited the former insiders who form Occupy the S.E.C. \u2014 and who recently submitted another impressive letter on the Volcker Rule in response to a request from Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, for \u201calternatives\u201d to it. \n Third, while the internal governance structure of the initiative is somewhat unclear, there is no reason to be optimistic about the decision-making process and the work product. The directors, Martin Neil Baily and Phillip Swagel, are former senior government officials who now work at think tanks (Mr. Baily is at Brookings and Mr. Swagel at the American Enterprise Institute and the Milken Institute) and a university (Mr. Swagel\u2019s primary appointment is on the faculty of the University of Maryland). \n Both are thoughtful people who are open to discussion. Mr. Swagel recently invited me to a forum at the Milken Institute where we debated \u2013 along with Harvey Rosenblum of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute \u2013 whether big banks should be forced to become smaller (and, in my view and Mr. Rosenblum\u2019s view, less dangerous). Mr. Swagel and Mr. Wallison strenuously opposed the proposition (you can watch this discussion on the C-Span archive). \n Two senior advisers, whose role is not made clear on the Web site, seem very similar to most task-force members in terms of their background and current work. Gregory P. Wilson worked in the past with the Financial Services Roundtable (a lobbying group for large banks) and is still an external adviser to the group. James C. Sivon, a top banking lawyer, is a former senior executive at the Association for Bank Holding Companies. \n The director of the initiative is Aaron Klein , a former senior Treasury official (under President Obama) who previously worked for Senator Chris Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. Mr. Klein wrote the white paper, along with Mr. Baily and Mr. Swagel. It is striking \u2013 and disappointing \u2013 to see such figures endorse the idea of a \u201cstability-growth trade-off\u201d (see Page 7) for modern financial regulation in the United States. \n This is the same attempted frame for the issues that I hear regularly from industry lobbyists and their lawyers (for example, at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission hearing on the Volcker Rule in May). \n This is entirely the wrong way to look at our financial sector, including the global megabanks that have come to predominate. This particular special interest has become too powerful \u2013 and is working hard to repeal the restrictions that can limit its ability to damage the economy again. \n Subsidizing, with implicit guarantees, the too-big-to-fail financial institutions is unfair and dangerous. Such subsidies distort and destroy markets. They undermine stability and make it harder to sustain growth. Fewer people will benefit from the growth that we do have. \n Let\u2019s be honest: Everyone would like an arrangement in which they personally get the upside and the taxpayer gets the downside. Imagine how much fun it would be to visit Las Vegas on that basis \u2013 and the size of the bets you would make. \n Asked to comment, Mr. Swagel said, \u201cIt is easy and wrong to say that efforts to change Dodd-Frank are to weaken it.\u201d He suggested that this bipartisan initiative could improve financial regulation and that such changes would be good for the economy and for all Americans. \n My view is that, unfortunately, the Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative of the Bipartisan Policy Center seems likely to side with industry lobby groups on all substantive questions. \n I hope I\u2019m wrong, but their initial paper and the task-force membership suggests that they will just be another cog in the vast Wall Street influence machinery that has come to dominate Washington. \n An edited version of this post previously appeared on the NYT.com Economix blog ; it is used here with permission.\u00a0 If you would like to reproduce the entire column, please contact the New York Times."], "link": "http://baselinescenario.com/2012/10/25/bipartisan-trouble-ahead/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/": 1, "http://topics.nytimes.com/": 2, "http://bettermarkets.com/": 1, "http://economix.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://law.duke.edu/": 1, "http://bipartisanpolicy.org/": 6, "http://www.cftc.gov/": 1, "http://www.businessweek.com/": 1, "http://www.columbia.edu/": 1, "http://www.occupythesec.org/": 1, "http://13bankers.com/": 1, "http://www.rochester.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Baseline Scenario"}, {"content": ["By James Kwak \n My Atlantic column this week is on a familiar theme: why don\u2019t Barack Obama and Democrats provide an clear alternative vision to the Romney-Ryan state of nature, instead of slowly stumbling along in the Republicans\u2019 wake? But it also brings up a question that I haven\u2019t seen before. \n The theoretical argument against higher tax rates is that it reduces the incentive to work because it changes the terms of the tradeoff between labor and leisure. That is, higher taxes reduce your effective returns from labor, while your returns from leisure remain constant, so you will substitute leisure for labor. \n In the long term, however, real wages tend to go up; even in the past three decades, which have generally been bad for labor (and good for capital), they\u2019ve gone up by about 11 percent. If tax rates remain constant, that should increase the effective returns to labor, causing people to substitute labor for leisure (i.e., work more). Put another way, you could increase tax rates and keep the tradeoff between labor and leisure constant. \n I generally don\u2019t buy these pure theoretical arguments, but my point is that if you believe that higher taxes reduce labor supply through the substitution effect, then you should acknowledge that the effect of higher taxes could be swamped by growth in real wages."], "link": "http://baselinescenario.com/2012/10/24/incentive-effects-of-higher-wages/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.theatlantic.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Baseline Scenario"}, {"content": ["By James Kwak \n Courtesy of Matt Yglesias , from the Financial Services Forum : \n \u201cWe write today to urge you to work together to reach a bipartisan agreement to avoid the approaching \u2018fiscal cliff,\u2019 and take concrete steps to restore the United States\u2019 long-term fiscal footing.\u201d \n And later: \n \u201cBut merely avoiding the fiscal cliff is not enough.

In\u00a0 13 Bankers , the revolving door was one of the three major channels through which the financial sector influenced government policy, alongside campaign contributions and the ideology of finance. The counterargument comes in various forms: people like Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson are dedicated civil servants who wouldn\u2019t favor their firms or their industries, the government needs people with appropriate industry experience, etc. \n It is certainly possible that industry experts provide valuable skills and experience to the government. But that value comes with a cost; put another way, it\u2019s not just the public good that benefits. Using data on Defense Department appointments, Simon Luechinger and Christoph Moser ( paper ; Vox summary ) measured the impact of political appointments on the stock market valuation of appointees\u2019 former firms; they also measured the impact on firms\u2019 stock market valuations of hiring a former government official. In both cases, the stock market reacted positively to new turns of the revolving door. Here\u2019s the chart for political appointments: \n  \n Luechinger and Moser survey the existing literature on the value of political connections in the first part of their paper. To summarize, this is the kind of thing that you expect to find in developing countries and countries with weak institutions\u2014not in the United States, the paragon of democracy and the greatness we never weren\u2019t . \n This research touches on one of the most important questions of our time: whether, in our age of extreme and increasing inequality, public policy has become the private preserve of the rich and the well-connected. In\u00a0 Why Nations Fail , Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson described the importance of inclusive political institutions for economic development. Although the United States became rich and powerful in large part because of our inclusive institutions, it is possible for an elite to shut down those institutions in order to further their economic interests, as occurred in late-medieval Venice. (For a summary, see my review of the book in\u00a0 Democracy. ) \n The disproportionate influence of economic elites on political decision-making is a hallmark of emerging market crises; its importance in the United States during the financial crisis was a central theme of \u201c The Quiet Coup \u201d and\u00a0 13 Bankers .

Did I do write something stupid? I wonder. \n A friend forwarded me Posner\u2019s latest blog post, \u201c Luck, Wealth, and Implications for Policy ,\u201d parts of which sound vaguely like a post I wrote three years ago, \u201c Do Smart, Hard-Working People Deserve To Make More Money? \u201c* In that post, I argued that even if differences in incomes are due to things that people ordinarily think of as \u201cmerit,\u201d like intelligence and hard work, that doesn\u2019t mean that rich people have a moral entitlement to their wealth, because they didn\u2019t do anything to deserve their intelligence or their propensity to work hard. In summary, \u201cI have little patience for the idea that rich people deserve what they have because they worked for it. It\u2019s just a question of how far back you are willing to acknowledge that chance enters the equation.\u201d \n Posner now goes even further than I did: \u201cI think\u00a0that ultimately everything is attributable to luck, good or bad,\u201d he writes, including the propensity for working hard, a low discount rate, and so on. \u201cIn short, I do not believe in free will. I think that everything that a person does is\u00a0caused by something. . . .\u00a0If this is right, a brilliant wealthy person like Bill Gates is not \u2018entitled\u2019 to his\u00a0wealth in some moral, Ayn Randian sense.\u201d \n He goes on\u2014he is still\u00a0 Richard Posner , after all\u2014to argue that tax policy should be concerned solely with incentive effects. High taxes on the wealthy are not unfair in any meaningful sense, and it is meaningless to say that rich people pay a disproportionate share of their income in taxes, absent some incentive-based argument. It does make sense to tax inherited wealth more than earned income, because of the incentives it creates. The same goes for investment profits, either because they are the product of luck (in the ordinary sense) or because people with lots of money are going to invest it anyway rather than consuming it all in the current period. \n But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite right to say that tax policy should be entirely utilitarian. Right now, our country faces large federal government deficits, the prospect of growing spending on social insurance programs, and sorely inadequate expenditures on infrastructure and the safety net. To fix those problems, money has to come from somewhere. If rich people don\u2019t have any particular moral entitlement to their wealth because that wealth is the product of luck in one form or another, isn\u2019t it obvious that they should pay more in taxes than poor and middle-class people? Imagine three people stranded on a desert island and a genie that gives one person ten coconuts, the second person two coconuts, and the third zero coconuts. Who should share with the third person: the first or the second? You can get the same result by looking at the marginal utility of wealth, \u00e0 la Diamond and Saez . \n Now redistribution can go too far because of the incentive effects, but that doesn\u2019t mean that redistribution is not an appropriate objective of the tax system. It just means that it has to be balanced against incentive considerations. There is a moral dimension to tax policy (although Diamond and Saez would call it part of utility maximization). It\u2019s just the opposite of what Paul Ryan thinks it is. \n * Of course, I\u2019m not saying that Posner is copying my ideas, since (a) there\u2019s virtually no chance that he knows who I am and (b) the ideas in that post, like most of my ideas, are pretty obvious."], "link": "http://baselinescenario.com/2012/10/16/luck-wealth-and-richard-posner/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://elsa.berkeley.edu/": 1, "http://baselinescenario.com/": 1, "http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Baseline Scenario"}, {"content": ["By James Kwak \n William Baumol and some co-authors recently published a new book on what is widely known as \u201cBaumol\u2019s cost disease.\u201d This is something that Simon wanted to include in\u00a0 White House Burning , but I couldn\u2019t find a good way to fit it in (and it would have gone in one of the chapter\u2019s I was writing), so I it isn\u2019t in there. (Baumol is cited for something else.) But in retrospect, I should have put it in. \n \n Baumol\u2019s argument, somewhat simplified, goes like this: Over time, average productivity in the economy rises. In some industries, automation and technology make productivity rise rapidly, producing higher real wages (because a single person can make a lot more stuff). But by definition, there most be some industries where productivity rises more slowly than the average. The classic example has been live classical music: it takes exactly as many person-hours to play a Mozart quartet today as it did two hundred years ago. You might be able to make a counterargument about the impact of recorded music, but the general point still holds. One widely cited example is education, where class sizes have stayed roughly constant for decades (and many educators think they should be smaller, not larger). Another is health care, where technology has vastly increased the number of possible treatments, but there is no getting around the need for in-person doctors and nurses. \n The problem is that in those industries with slow productivity growth, real wages also have to rise; otherwise you couldn\u2019t attract people to become classical musicians, teachers, or nurses. Since costs are rising faster than productivity, prices have to rise in real terms. Note that university tuition and health care costs are both going up much faster than overall inflation. As a consequence, since GDP is measured in terms of prices paid, these sectors take up a growing share of GDP, just as health care is doing throughout the developed world. \n But in Baumol\u2019s formulation, that\u2019s just fine. To see why, consider this figure from the Economist\u2019s review of the book : \n Look at the right-hand panel. The point is that if you extrapolate from current trends, health care will be a ridiculous proportion of the economy a century from now, even if we do nothing to slow its rate of growth; but because of productivity increases, the non-health care sector will still be much bigger than it is today, so we will still be much better off than today in aggregate.* \n But that doesn\u2019t mean that everything is fine and dandy. Unlike a lot of things in the light blue portion of that chart, health care is a necessity. If 60 percent of the economy is health care, health care will be a much larger share of the average family\u2019s budget than it is today; and if it\u2019s a huge share of the average family\u2019s budget, then many families with below-average incomes won\u2019t be able to afford it. \n This is the basic problem with market-based approaches to our health care problem: in a free market, poor people won\u2019t get any, and middle-class people won\u2019t get very much. Baumol is right that in the aggregate our society will be able to pay for all the health care we need, and plenty of other stuff besides; but with our current level of inequality, many actual families won\u2019t be able to get the care they need. \n Now, Baumol himself realizes this. One corollary of Baumol\u2019s cost disease is that as low-productivity sectors get relatively more expensive, it gets harder and harder to make a profit, so they tend to get taken over by the government. Again, consider health care and education. (Classical music, which cannot make a profit but is not a necessity\u2014much as I love it\u2014has instead been taken over by private charity.) And this is just the way it should be: Everyone needs health care, but the law of productivity increases dictates that it gets more and more expensive, so the only sane solution is to keep prices at an affordable level and let the government bear the losses. And by \u201cbear the losses,\u201d I mean distribute them to taxpayers (since there is no entity called \u201cthe government\u201d that exists in isolation from the people) through a progressive tax system. \n Guess what? That\u2019s what Medicare does today. (The Medicare payroll tax isn\u2019t progressive, but most of Parts B and D are funded through general revenues, which mainly come from the individual income tax.) By contrast, Romney-Ryan Vouchercare, by capping the growth rate of benefits at an artificially low level, shifts the growing stack of health care costs (dark blue in the chart) directly onto families, many of whom won\u2019t be able to afford it. Vouchercare is an attempt to rein in health care costs through sheer force of will. It won\u2019t work. It can\u2019t work. \n This was, in essence, one of the key arguments of\u00a0 White House Burning : health care costs are going to be what they are going to be, and we\u00a0can pay for them. Yes we can. We can pay for them because we have plenty of room to raise taxes in all sorts of non-distorting or distortion-reducing ways. We can pay for them because productivity increases mean that, in aggregate, our after-tax real income is still going up. This means that tax revenues will grow as a share of the economy, but as Baumol\u2019s cost disease implies, they should rise as a share of the economy. Comparing tax revenues today to tax revenues in a distant past when health care costs were much lower is just not relevant. \n * That chart isn\u2019t per capita, but eyeballing it it looks like a fourfold increase in non-health care GDP; with U.S. population growing at a little less than 1 percent, that\u2019s still a big increase in per capita non-health care GDP."], "link": "http://baselinescenario.com/2012/10/12/why-taxes-should-pay-for-health-care/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.amazon.com/": 1, "http://www.economist.com/": 1, "http://baselinescenario.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://whitehouseburning.com": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Baseline Scenario"}, {"content": ["By Simon Johnson \n With the presidential election looming and both sides looking for a knockout blow in the vice-presidential debate on Thursday evening, now is a good time for both Democrats and Republicans to look for one more defining issue. The new book by Sheila Bair, \u201c Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street From Wall Street and Wall Street From Itself ,\u201d offers exactly that \u2013 to whichever party is smart enough and fast enough to take up the opportunity. \n Ms. Bair lays out a compelling vision for both financial-sector reform and for dealing with the continuing mess around mortgages. Neither presidential campaign is likely to endorse her ideas in all their specifics. But if a candidate signaled that he had read and understood the main messages in this book, this would have great appeal both with undecided centrist votes and \u2013 importantly \u2013 with their respective bases. \n Ms. Bair was chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from June 2006 until July 2011. In that position, she had a seat at the table for all the big decisions during the financial crisis of 2007-9, and she was also an important player during the financial reform negotiations of 2009-10, leading up to the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010. \n (Disclosure: I\u2019m a member of the nongovernmental Systemic Risk Council that Ms. Bair created and leads; I was also appointed to the F.D.I.C.\u2019s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee while Ms. Bair was still chairwoman.) \n Ms. Bair, a Republican from Kansas, worked with Bob Dole and was appointed to the F.D.I.C. by President George W. Bush. Her defining positions were against the interests of the very largest financial institutions. \n And her biggest confrontations were with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and \u2013 according to Ms. Bair \u2013 someone who continually favored the largest banks and their profitability in the mistaken view that this would serve the broader social interest in financial stability and sustained economic prosperity. \n During the height of the financial crisis, Mr. Geithner wanted at various times to commit more taxpayer resources with fewer conditions to support very large banks, including allowing them to pay very large bonuses to executives. Ms. Bair was consistently on the side of wanting more strings attached \u2013 the point being that these financial institutions had managed themselves into great trouble. As she notes on Page 363: \n \u201cAn institution that is profitable is not necessarily one that is safe and sound or one that is serving the public interest. All of the large financial institutions were profitable in the years leading up to the crisis, but they were making big profits by taking big risks that ultimately exploded in their \u2013 and our \u2013 faces.\u201d \n Ms. Bair\u2019s point was not about any kind of retribution but rather that the long experience of the F.D.I.C. indicates that the best time to clean up any financial sector mess is at the moment and point of intervention. Because it has insured small depositors \u2013 the public \u2013 since the 1930s, the F.D.I.C. has developed a well-informed approach to failing banks. It works long and hard to ensure that depositor protection works \u2013 and it does \u2013 without imposing costs on the taxpayer. \n When I worked at the International Monetary Fund during 2004-6 and 2007-8, we regarded the F.D.I.C. as carrying out best practice in the world with regard to how to handle failing banks. \n In Ms. Bair\u2019s persuasive account, both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations were primarily focused on protecting the large banks. Both administrations consistently ignored the relationship between the need to fix our bloated, free-wheeling financial sector and sustaining our broader economic prosperity. And both administrations paid insufficient attention to the persistent problem of mortgages. \n In most financial crises, there is some form of \u201cdebt overhang\u201d problem \u2013 meaning that the economy cannot fully get back on its feet until loans are written down, typically through some form of bankruptcy or negotiated restructuring process. Some of the most fascinating details in \u201cBull by the Horns\u201d concern instances when Ms. Bair and her F.D.I.C. colleagues proposed various ways to deal with mortgages, only to be shot down or undermined by Mr. Geithner and his colleagues at Treasury (see, for example, Chapter 21). \n Judging from the most recent presidential debate, the candidates are still not drawing the link from stable finance to economic prosperity, and they are offering no ideas on how to restructure mortgages. \n As new cases are brought against big banks for their mortgage-lending practices \u2013 including JPMorgan Chase (for activities of Bear Stearns , which it acquired in 2008) and, this week, Wells Fargo \u2013 policy thinking increasingly must grapple with how to structure a potential \u201cglobal settlement\u201d on mortgages. \n Hopefully, Ms. Bair will have a seat at that table; most of the workable ideas are already articulated in her book.\u00a0 More broadly, her policy suggestions are simple and obvious, such as: putting tougher limits on the ability of large financial institutions to take risks with borrowed money; requiring those who securitize mortgages to retain risk if the mortgages later default; and breaking up institutions which are so large and interconnected that they cannot be resolved in bankruptcy without causing wider damage to our economy. \n Ms. Bair\u2019s messages and common sense have appeal across the American political spectrum. The right wants an end to implicit government subsidies for large financial institutions. The left wants to curtail the power of global megabanks. Independents want Wall Street to have less political sway in Washington. These are all reasonable and responsible requests. \n Either Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama could seize upon the themes in Ms. Bair\u2019s book, craft these into political language and hammer home the substance in the concluding weeks of the campaign. \n Or they could just quote the final paragraph of the book: \n \u201cLife goes on, as Robert Frost observed. But financial abuse and misconduct don\u2019t have to. Tell the powers in Washington that you want these problems fixed, you want them fixed now and that you will hold all incumbents accountable until the job is done.\u201d \n An edited version of this post appeared on the NYT.com\u2019s Economix blog; it is used here with permission.\u00a0 If you would like to reproduce the entire column, please contact the New York Times."], "link": "http://baselinescenario.com/2012/10/11/read-this-book-win-the-election/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://books.simonandschuster.com/": 1, "http://dealbook.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://topics.nytimes.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Baseline Scenario"}, {"content": ["By James Kwak \n Adam Davidson wrote his latest New York Times Magazine column about how Barack Obama and Mitt Romney largely agree on economic questions. This is a classic example of how to mislead through deceptively selective citation. \n Here\u2019s the core assertion: \n For someone who lived in the first 150 years or so of this country, it might be hard to see what\u2019s so different about the economic policies of\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0and\u00a0Mitt Romney. Romney seeks a 25 percent top corporate tax rate, and Obama is proposing 28 percent. Romney wants to eliminate capital-gains taxes for the typical investor and leave the rate at 15 percent for higher earners. Obama wants to increase it to 20 percent. They differ on how to tax the highest incomes. But for most Americans, the distinctions might be mistaken for a rounding error. Both men strongly support expanding free trade and maintaining close to the same level of Social Security and welfare benefits. \n As anyone who follows fiscal policy knows, the corporate tax rate is a sideshow. It\u2019s the individual income tax and payroll taxes that bring in the big dollars, and it\u2019s the individual income tax that has the real impact (or not) on inequality. \n Mitt Romney wants to lower the top individual tax rate to 28 percent; Obama wants to let it increase to 39.6 percent. When you add in the Medicare payroll tax, Romney\u2019s rate increases to 30.9 percent, while Obama\u2019s increases to 43.4 percent. (Romney wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would mean repealing the 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on high-income households.) That means Obama\u2019s tax rate would be 40 percent higher than Romney\u2019s. That\u2019s a rounding error? \n What about capital gains taxes? Davidson says the difference is between 15 percent and 20 percent. But the Affordable Care Act imposes a Medicare tax on investment income of 3.8 percent for high earners (which, again, Romney would repeal), so the real difference is between 15 percent at 23.8 percent; Obama\u2019s proposed tax rate is 59 percent higher than Romney\u2019s. That\u2019s not a significant difference? \n Davidson cites agreement on Social Security and welfare. Social Security, yes, at least for now, since Romney doesn\u2019t want to touch that rail. (His running mate, by contrast, has supported privatization in the past.) I\u2019m not sure what he means by \u201cwelfare,\u201d but he certainly can\u2019t mean Medicaid, the largest anti-poverty program. Romney wants to convert Medicaid into a block grant, which in itself would have major impacts on poor people in states that, well, don\u2019t want to help poor people. More importantly, Romney would limit growth in the size of Medicaid grants to inflation plus one percentage point, which is far less than actual health care inflation. So relative to current policy, Medicaid spending would be much lower under Romney\u2014$1.3 trillion over nine years, according to Bloomberg . And, again, Romney wants to repeal the ACA, which includes an expansion Medicaid spending in order to increase coverage. Those all seem like big differences to me. \n Finally, Davidson conveniently neglects to mention Medicare, where the differences between the candidates are greatest. Obama wants to maintain the basic structure of Medicare, where benefits are a percentage of real health care costs. Romney wants to change Medicare to a voucher program, where the growth rate of benefits is capped regardless of the growth of actual health care costs. (Obama also wants to reduce the growth rate of benefits, but that\u2019s a target, not a cap; he isn\u2019t proposing a change to the benefit structure.) First of all, these proposals vastly differ in the role of the private sector and how they expect to control health care costs. Even leaving that aside, however, they fundamentally differ in who bears the risk of health care inflation. Obama leaves it with Medicare, hence the federal government; Romney shifts it to individuals. \n In short, there isn\u2019t a baldly incorrect fact in the passage from Davidson\u2019s column above, but it\u2019s hard to see how it could be more misleading. There are huge differences between Obama and Romney when it comes to taxes and social insurance programs, and they are sitting out there for anyone to see. \n I used to like Planet Money, and many of its reporting-based episodes are still excellent. But ever since the health care debates, I\u2019ve become more and more tired of its tone of cute, isn\u2019t-this-fascinating contrarianism. I generally avoid criticizing them because I like the people there whom I met and because they are affiliated with This American Life, my favorite show in any medium, so I give them the benefit of the doubt. But this column epitomizes everything that is wrong with the journalistic, \u201ctell me a story\u201d approach to economics and public policy: looking for an original angle to take through well-trodden terrain, thumbing your nose at the conventional wisdom, and backing it up with correct but incomplete facts.

It\u2019s a pretty mathematical paper (and I\u2019m not just talking about the usual multivariate regression here), and I didn\u2019t make it through all the equations. But the basic idea is to come up with a model that might explain the high degree of income and wealth inequality we see in advanced economies and particularly in the United States, where 1 percent of the population holds 33 percent of all wealth. \n What\u2019s fascinating is that the model assumes that all households are identical with respect to patience (consumption decisions) and skill (earnings ability). Household outcomes differ solely because they have idiosyncratic investment opportunities\u2014that is, they can\u2019t invest in the market, only in things like privately-held businesses or unique pieces of real estate. Yet when you simulate the model, you see an increasing share of wealth finding its way into fewer and fewer hands: \n  \n As the authors emphasize, \u201cit is luck alone \u2013 in the form of high realised random investment returns \u2013 that generates this extreme divergence.\u201d \u00a0In the absence of redistribution, either explicit or implicit, this is the kind of society you end up with. \n Obviously this isn\u2019t a complete explanation of the high and increasing degree of inequality in American society today. People are not equal in their earning ability, for one. But you could view the variance in career outcomes\u2014that is, from equivalent starting points, some people will just be luckier and earn more than others\u2014as a type of the idiosyncratic risk that Fernholz and Fernholz focus on. \n I think this is a useful antidote to the widespread belief that outcomes are solely due to skill, hard work, or some other \u201cvirtuous\u201d attribute. Even if everyone starts off equal, you\u2019re going to have a few big, big winners and a lot of losers. Because we want to find order and meaning in the universe, we like to think that success is deserved, but it almost always comes with a healthy serving of luck.

So now Apple has a patent on a universal search box that searches across multiple sources. That\u2019s something that Google and other companies have been doing for years, although perhaps not before 2004, when Apple first applied. There\u2019s another kind of examiner shopping, where you file multiple, similar patents on the same day and hope that they go to different examiners, one of whom is likely to grant the patent. \n According to law professor Jay Kesan, things are fine as they are: \u201cIf someone gets a bad patent, so what? You can request a re-examination. You can go to court to invalidate the patent.\u201d But Kesan must know the costs of patent litigation\u2014potentially tens of millions of dollars for a trial that goes on for years, which can easily swamp a startup\u2019s budget.
