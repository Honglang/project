I subscribed to Crikey this year - which I now regret. Here is an example of the nonsense that passes for journalism there and elsewhere. \n \n Essential research did a poll asking \n How much sexism and discrimination against women do you think currently occurs in the \u2026.? \n workplace, media, politics, advertising, sport, schools. The allowed responses were none, a little, some or a lot .\u00a0Few reasonable people could answer none, unless they are in an industry\u00a0where there is formal or informal affirmative action. Most people would surely say a little or some . I am not even clear what the difference between a little and some is anyway. \n To put it simply, you could ask people \u201chow much racism is there..\u201d, \u201chow much\u00a0anti-semitism is there..\u201d, \u201chow mcuh religious extremism is there\u2026\u201d, \u201chow much belief in extra-terrestriall life is there\u2026.\u201d, and the majority of people would give, in my view,\u00a0the correct answer of either a little or some . \n Seen in this light, the results \u00a0of the sexism poll (reproduced below) are incredibly bland. Excluding the don\u2019t knows, around 70% of people said a little or some . Tracking changes of this figure over time might conceivably be interesting, but the number itself is not. \n So Crickey did not report this number. Instead,\u00a0the\u00a0reporter chose to combine\u00a0the some and a lot categories\u00a0which came in at about\u00a050% or higher. This was somehow thought to be significantly high, even though this \u201ccategory\u201d was dominated by the \u201csome\u201d responders. \n It gets worse though. The reporter, Cathy Alexander,\u00a0continued \n The poll found those who think sexism is not a factor in women\u2019s lives may be experiencing a utopian fantasy. Less than 15% of those polled thought there was no sexism at work at all in each of our major institutions. \n The stated argument is that because the category has the smallest percentage, they must be wrong. Now, I actually think they are wrong, but the reasoning is just oxymoronic. \n So the article was a\u00a0 total beat up of\u00a0a pointless poll whose results were predictably bland, the reporting of it was biased and the discussion logically flawed. \n \n  \n \n \n \u00a0 \n Lot \n Some \n Little \n None \n DK \n \n \n In workplaces \n 17% \n 38% \n 32% \n 6% \n 7% \n \n \n In the media \n 19% \n 37% \n 29% \n 9% \n 7% \n \n \n In politics \n 25% \n 36% \n 25% \n 8% \n 7% \n \n \n In advertising \n 31% \n 28% \n 26% \n 8% \n 7% \n \n \n In sport \n 24% \n 34% \n 25% \n 10% \n 7% \n \n \n In schools \n 12% \n 31% \n 33% \n 14% \n 10% \n \n \n \n \ufffd"], "link": "http://blogs.mbs.edu/fishing-in-the-bay/?p=278", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.com.au/": 1, "http://essentialvision.com.au/": 1, "http://news.yahoo.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Fishing in the Bay"}, {"content": ["The University of Melbourne was founded in 1885 with five professors teaching 15 students. In 1952, at the start of the post-war tertiary boom, there were around 3,000 Australian academics teaching 30,000 students across eight Universities. There are now some 43,000 academics servicing 1.2 million students (28% of them international) across 41 Australian universities . \n Based on the past 60 years, you might predict a bright future for academics in 2072. However, I would not be surprised if the number of genuine academic positions returns to 1952 levels. \n Researching and teaching \n Academics create knowledge through largely unfunded research; they generate curriculum; they deliver lectures; they accredit learning. While teaching superficially pays for research, the argument has been that the deep knowledge derived from doing research leads to better curriculum and teaching. \n So research is an essential cost input to teaching, and these two activities are bundled rather than one subsidising the other. \n Unbundle them and the dynamics become unsustainable with growing student numbers that no longer mean a growing number of academics. The internet has changed everything. \n Knowledge middle men \n \n When I started lecturing in 1978, I would take one or two textbooks and write out my own lecture notes. The content would find its way into the students\u2019 notes through a mass lecture. \n These days, I design new courses by trawling the web for the latest content, topical examples and exercises. I feel more and more like a dispensable middle man between freely available content and captured students. More worrying, I strongly suspect I am not the world\u2019s best translator of free content into course materials. \n I deliver the course to the students in a big hall. Here is another insight. Try as I might to inspire and engage, I am not the world\u2019s best lecturer either. \n Surely, 60 years from now, the very best curriculum and audio visual presentations will be collected, digitised and organised. Rather than pay me to produce second best, Universities will purchase premium course materials, perhaps from specialist curriculum generating universities or from private content creators. \n Or perhaps they will get the materials entirely free! The Khan Academy has a growing library of freely available lecture style videos and has financial backing from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as Google. \n Wherever the content comes from, students will consume it at home, and supplement their learning through tutorials. They will watch a macroeconomics lecture by Paul Krugman and discuss any learning blocks with post-docs in tutorial sessions and on-line fora. \n They will not need to see the likes of me. \n Could it really happen? \n \n Many of my colleagues argue against these predictions. Mostly, I think they confuse what they would like to happen with what is likely to happen. \n First, they argue there is no such thing as the \u201cbest\u201d curriculum and lecture in a given subject. They may be right, but this is not critical to the argument. There need not be a single best lecture, but there will be concentration towards premium quality. \n The point is that there are probably several hundred academics in Australia who lecture on, say, regression analysis, and very few of us could claim to be in the top 1% \u2013 actually only 1% of us. \n The web allows 100% of the students to access the best 1%. Where is the market for duplication of mediocre course material by research academics? \n Second, they argue that students need and thrive on the organic interaction that is possible in a lecture . But do they want it? \n I am not sure that there is much interaction in most lectures anyway. Moreover, I think Gen Y and their kids will consider 400 students in a lecture hall an anachronism. I wonder whether they will be able to concentrate for more than five minutes in a row . \n Electronic interactions through small groups will be the absolute norm. Students will like it; financial administrators will like it. \n Third, some colleagues point out that there is value in allowing diversity in available content; that the process of different universities trying new things ultimately leads to evolution of better content. This may be true but it is an economic externality. \n Generating untried and speculative course material is not cost effective for the generator. Students and administrators will migrate towards \u201cthe best\u201d and proven content. \n So the future I describe may lead to less curriculum evolution, I agree. But that is not to say that it won\u2019t happen. \n What about accreditation? \n \n Accreditation is another core function of universities which they currently monopolise. High quality content is worth little unless it comes with a sanctioned university degree. \n A degree is a quality guarantee of both content and learning outcome. It is dependent upon a university\u2019s reputation which, in turn, is largely built on research reputation. So universities will always have reason to be involved in research, even unfunded research if it is cutting edge and newsworthy. \n I cannot see the private sector usurping this role. \n But will Australian universities really need 43,000 researchers for this? Clearly not. They might opt for a small research core in each department, to establish each program\u2019s bona-fides. \n The research core may only comprise a couple of elite professors, over-seeing doctoral programs and externally funded research positions and vouching for the quality and currency of the courses delivered. \n The prism of history \n Many may argue that it is daft to predict what will happen in 60 years. But I find it liberating to see the here-and-now through the prism of historical facts and forces, and to realise that the status quo need not continue. \n My academic generation has lived through an unprecedented boom in tertiary studies. Living within history can blind us to a wider historical perspective which reveals the boom as a short-term unsustainable anomaly. \n Student numbers exploded and the bundling of academic activities meant that academic numbers also exploded. Decoupled teaching and research could mean academic numbers easily decline. \n It does not give me great pleasure to make these predictions, nor though do I think it is necessarily a bad thing. More people might get better educated in the future, without the need for people like me, well-rounded academics who are good at both teaching and research. People like me will find something else useful to do. \n In world where teaching and research are not so tightly linked, it is not good enough to be a very good researcher and a very good teacher.

Recently at Club Troppo, he has posted on his top five economic reforms that make\u2019 good economics in the sense of being in the interest of the long-run welfare of Australia.\u201d One of them involves the ABS\u2026. \n I have always found ABS phone staff pretty helpful and there is plenty of free stuff on their site that is reasonably easy to search once you get the hang of it. But, as someone who just paid the ABS $450 for 5 years of data on deaths broken down by exact age and gender, I am not presently disposed to feel kindly towards them. The births are totally free but not the deaths! The good news is gratis, but you have to pay for the bad news!? Moreover, it seems to me that the external spill-overs from open information are great enough that all the data should be provided free. That is not Paul\u2019s main gripe however. \n Paul wants to turn the ABS over to private providers. Here is what he says: \n \n Reduce the budget of the Australian Bureau of Statistics by about 90%, reducing it to merely being in charge of running the Census, and instead commission private providers of statistics to generate surveys of Australian businesses and the population. This would involve a quick reduction of around 300 million a year in expenses and would immediately improve the data available for economic decision making. \n \n \n Why does he think private providers would improve data availability for economic decision making? \n \n The rational for cutting off the ABS is that it is completely secretive about the data it gathers: only ABS officials are trusted with using the full data by the ABS, not other government departments or Australian researchers. We are thus in the fairly ridiculous situation that those who devise the Australian budget in the Treasury do not have access to all the data gathered on the finances of individual industries. The ABS hides behind laws promising confidentiality to prevent anyone else from using its data, but similar laws on secrecy exist in other countries that have not been interpreted as \u2018only people in our statistics organisation can be trusted\u2019. Quite simply, the ABS has turned into a secretive rent-seeking organisation that draws huge subsidies but does not feel obliged to share its products with its paymasters. Why then should the Australian public pay for data that is not used to improve our knowledge of Australia? It might as well not exist and if it didn\u2019t exist, the community would be free to buy data from other sources that are more consumer-friendly. \n \n \n I have an anecdote about my own experience with the ABS and an opinion on why I think privatization is not the answer. About three years ago, I was giving a talk at the ABS in Brisbane. It was actually a talk about statisticians publicly engaging more. Part of the talk involved linking to this modest blog. \n I arrive 45 minutes before the talk and managed to get through security. I then passed my USB containing the powerpoint slides to the fellow who had invited me. There was a look of horror followed by embarrassment. \u201cYou can\u2019t use that in here\u201d he said gravely. \u201cThe IT guys won\u2019t allow it.\u201d \n All the PC\u2019s in the building had software installed\u00a0to prevented the use of USB\u2019s. Apparently, I was supposed to have sent my slides to the IT department who would scan it and upload it to the presentation PC themselves. Their gravest\u00a0angst was spyware entering their database. This single fear of data security seemed to have supplanted their main mission which is data collection and distribution . \n Getting the files to the IT guys was not at all easy either. It was not a matter of walking down to the dungeon. But I will spare your the details. \n So the talk did go ahead after a stressful beginning. And you can imagine what happened when I tried to link to Fishing in the Bay during the talk. The PC nearly crashed! \n So Paul is absolutely right about the paranoid, obsessive privacy culture of the ABS. It is virtually impossible to get unit record data. The issue though is where that culture comes from and whether privatization would be the solution. \n It is not just the ABS that is paranoid about privacy. Try ringing Telstra or Yarra Valley Water to check your bill. If the account happens to be in your partner\u2019s name, you are likely to hit a wall. Imagine what someone could do with the personal information of my water consumption! The really annoying thing about Telstra\u2019s cynical sham of a privacy policy is that they sold all our records to India years ago, which is why marketers can ring you up at dinner time and know your first name. Telstra have\u00a0 not kept up with the hackers , so they\u00a0 make you think they are a data fortress by refusing to tell your details even to you! \n Don\u2019t just blame the companies though. Australian privacy legislation is pretty strict. And I think it has public support. Remember the crazy panic over the Australia Card 25 years ago? There is an unarticulated public fear of information security and privacy. And I think it\u00a0has recently increased because of the quite real risk of identity theft and credit card fraud. Though people seem to forget that credit card fraud is\u00a0mainly a problem for the banks, as the customer is not liable for the losses. \n So, what about privatizing the ABS? There would be immediate howls of protest about privacy. The government could only outsource this function if they responded by imposing restrictions on data security that would possibly be even more extreme than the Brisbane branch of the ABS. We would end up in a worse situation than we are now, I fear. \n In subsequent comments, it appears that Paul has something different in mind - that Government departments and research institutes take responsibility for dissemination, rather than the ABS.\u00a0He contrasts his experience with obtaining data from the The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children \u00a0which is not controlled by the ABS, though they collect the data. Virtually all data is made available to someone from a reputable institution who is prepared to sign a confidentiality agreement. \n Which seems to imply that \n * there is nothing about government provision per se which leads to poor service and obsession with secrecy \n * there is nothing in privacy legislation that prevents the ABS from giving out unit record data. \n Perhaps he is right about an entrenched culture at the ABS being specific to the ABS.

There has been a provocative article by Steven King saying thanks very much Melbourne for sending us so many of your best and brightest. There was a rebuttal by Glyn Davis saying that what Melbourne lose in under-graduate enrolments they more than make up for in specialist masters students, and that this was always the intention. There is a placatory article by Monash VC Ed Byrne . I added a comment to his article which got blown up into an Australian article so I guess I won\u2019t apply for a job at Monash any time soon**. \n There are a couple of nice discussion of the issues (including comments) by Professor Paul Fritjers \u00a0 ( here and here ) which you might like to look at. I thought it might be worth while putting my thoughts down here, in a more complete manner than is possible within a blog comment. \n \n There are three core ideas with the Melbourne model, which often get bundled into one. The first is to force students into a general degree, for the purpose of broadening their education and making them better citizens and more rounded employees. The second is to increase the number of students who extend their degree to 5 years and, let\u2019s be frank, to\u00a0charge very high fees for the last two years. The third, which is related to but distinct from the first, is to prevent high school students locking in a place in elite courses that lead to closed shop elite careers. \n The broadening idea is good in principle. High school students are unlikely to have full information on how well a vocation may suit them and have limited exposure to fields outside their VCE study. So it makes sense to restrict their ability to specialize too early. However, it can and has been argued (for instance by Fritjers) that the idea has been taken too far. Some of the breadth subjects are less rigorous and demanding than would be\u00a0dlivered to a fully engaged specialist student\u00a0 \u2013 necessarily so, if you want arts students to take a science subject. An alternative and less ambitious model would have been to have retained the rigour of existing courses, while still forcing students to do say 25% of their studies in other faculties. So for instance, Math students would do econometrics in the economics department, psychology students would do statistics in the math department, architecture students would do engineering\u00a0etc. This would lessen the incentive to dilute the content of courses for a non-specialist audience. While it would admittedly mean less broadening,\u00a0maximal broadening is not necessarily optimal. A revised system would\u00a0allow students to move 45 degrees from the subjects that they already have an aptitude for, and are interest in \u2013 rather than 180 degrees as is the result of the current\u00a0Melbourne model. \n The second reason for the model is economic. Under the current model, a student finishes with a general arts degree (but with some forced low level broadening subjects) and is not very employable. Their generalist degree is\u00a0likely to be worth less in the job market than the previous 3-year vocational degrees. So students have a strong reason to move to the two year vocational masters subjects that follow.\u00a0 The charge for these courses\u00a0can be very\u00a0high, and they are not limited in number or fee structures the same way that under-graduate places are.\u00a0 As one example, the Melbourne Law School charges around k$100 for the law degree (called the JD). Roughly half the students (all local) have to pay\u00a0this full fee. Students need not pay up front, but will carry a large debt into their first job. \n The third\u00a0reason for the\u00a0Melbourne model\u00a0is to prevent high school students choosing their vocation at the age of 17, especially to prevent them locking in a place in an elite program like Law or medicine. They do allow students with extremely high ENTER scores to lock in a place, subject to reasonable performance standards in their under-graduate degree, but they still have to do the general under-graduate degree. There are educational arguments for this which have\u00a0already been explained above. There is an even stronger ethical and economic\u00a0argument.\u00a0 \n Under the old model, most students in elite degrees came from incredibly advantaged educational backgrounds. This does huge damage to our society and also to the economy. It is rightly perceived as unequal; it is incredibly expensive for private school parents who hand over about k$100 for their child to essentially jump the queue; it is uneconomic because it is not merit based. Under the Melbourne model, students compete on the level playing field of the university, to gain entry to medicine/law. I cannot understand why the governmetn does not enforce such a system on every G* university. It should be illegal to allocate law/medicine places to kids who got their good results because of an elite education. The Melbourne model\u00a0can only lead to fairer and more merit based outcomes. It has been argued that, under the old Melbourne and competing systems,\u00a0there were other non-VCE pathways into medicine and law. That may be true, but the fact that the back door was left ajar\u00a0does not change the fact that the bouncers on the front door were mainly\u00a0admitting people in private school uniforms. \n \u00a0 \n **Beware of commenting on this article.

The main\u00a0Theorem 4 gives a formula for a largest possible lower limit\u00a0for a scalar parameter in an\u00a0arbitrary discrete distribution. Unfortunately, this construction was first given by Robert Buehler (JASA,1957).\u00a0The proof of its optimality was given by Jobe and David (JASA,1992)\u00a0under a non-trivial restriction. The proof was generalised\u00a0to remove this restriction by Lloyd & Kabaila (ANZJS,2003). \n The paper by Wang includes reference to Bol\u2019shev (1965). That paper refers to Buehler (1957). Indeed it is mainly about Buehler (1957). \n The paper by Wang also contained an additional Proposition 2 which, in non-technical terms,\u00a0says that a more informative statistic can never generate a worse Buehler lower limit than a less-informative statistic. This result was proven\u00a0in Kabaila & Lloyd (ANZJS,2004) where we also gave conditions under which the lower limit will be strictly better rather than only no worse. \n I sent the details of this sorry saga to the editor of Annals,\u00a0 Peter Buhlmann ,\u00a0who responded within two days that that the record could be set straight with a two page paper authored by Paul Kabaila and myself. The publication process was hurried it should appear in the December issue. Well done Peter Buhlmann and Annals of Statistics! My faith is renewed.\u00a0I am not sure all editors would be prepared to do this. \n In fact, I know from personal experience that they don\u2019t. \n About 7 years ago Biometrika published a paper,\u00a0 Using logistic regression procedures for estimating receiver operating characteristic curves , by Jing Qin and Biao Zhang.

However, I had submitted this same paper to Biometrika two years earlier and\u00a0had it rejected.\u00a0\u00a0You join the dots yourself. \n The editor of the time, Mike Titterington, told me that Biometrika do not publish letters. Instead, he got the authors themselves to publish an erratum . This was totally inadequate in my view and does not correct the record. If you don\u2019t believe me, try Googling \u201c Using logistic regression procedures for estimating receiver operating characteristic curves\u201d and see what you get. You sure don\u2019t get the erratum or anything with my name in it. \n It is hard to know what to do when you have your work plagiarised.

The success rate is around 23%. On Nov 3 this year, they posted a \u201cconsultation document\u201d ( HERE ) outlining what appear to be some pretty major changes to the Discovery scheme. If my understanding of this document is correct, the proposed changes are ill-conceived. They divert money to poorer projects, create perverse incentives and manifestly fail to solve the main problem that the ARC claim to be worried about. \n Let\u2019s get to the nuts and bolts then. It is all about grant success rates and some statistical patterns that appear when this measure is broken down by various factors. \n Throughout the discussion below, an early career researcher (ECR) is someone less than 5 years post Ph.D. You might not like this definition, but it is the current one (the ARC are actually considering loosening it). \n Issue 1: Experience \n Success rates are lower for ECR only proposals - around 18.4% for ECR only proposals and around 25.5% for others, in 2009. Remember that the overall success rate is about 23%. This difference has persisted for many years, see HERE .\u00a0\u00a0I do not think that any academic in Australia would be surprised\u00a0that ECRs have a lower success rate. Is it unfair? Is it a problem that needs fixing? \n First, success rates are not the right measure. They do not tell you\u00a0 how much money is going to ECRs. This is pertinent because\u00a0many of the successful grants of senior researchers will be to support ECR post-docs! The glory may go to the CI, but the money is going to the ECR. \n Second, accepting success rate as the key performance measure, imagine\u00a0an ARC grant that is written by an ECR with no other experienced team members. Such proposals have a lower succss rate. The ARC seem to think that the success rate should be the same as that of a senior researcher. \n In what parallel universe do\u00a0ECR\u2019s emerge from their PhD with the same skill base, research links, and maturity as a 45 year old Professor? In reality, many ECR proposals will be flawed. Moreover, lack of experience makes successful execution of the research program more risky than for an experienced researcher. So even with two equally good proposals, it would be perfectly sensible to fund the more experienced team. \n A non-academic might reasonable ask \u201cHow do young researchers ever get started then?\u201d We all know the answer. Mentoring. It was made clear to me, early in my career, that the best way to get an ARC grant was to team up with a more senior researcher. This is a good thing. The role of mentor and ECR is a mutually beneficial one, and has been a central pillar of academic culture for generations. Incentivising ECR-only projects is a direct attack on this healthy tradition. \n Issue 2: Gender \n Success rates have been consistently lower for females (by a modest amount). What could explain this? Well,\u00a0it turns out that\u00a0females are\u00a0over-represented in ECRs and under-represented at higher experience levels. Could the gender gap then just be driven by their having lower experience? \n The answer is no. The gender gap is real. If you restrict attention to ECR only proposals then the gap is 16.5% for females compared to 19.9% for males averaged over 2001-2009, see HERE for the graph. \n Below is an even more revealing graph. It shows the success rates for males and females broken into 7 groups of experience (the average of the team). As you can see, the gender gap is consistent across 0-15 years - it is not just ECRs. The graph also shows the earlier stated fact that females are over-represented amongst the less experienced applicants - not that this explains the differing success rates because we have controlled for experience in this graph. \n \n But it set the ARC onto quite the wrong track. You see, they got the idea that they could fix the gender problem by discriminating in favour of ECRs.\u00a0 \n The ARC proposal \n The ARC consultation document says that \n The ARC has hosted a number of discussions about ECR and gender to understand their relationship and thereby propose a means to address disadvantage in success rates\u2026.By addressing this issue \u2026 the aim is to remove gender difference across ARC schemes as a totality. \n Laudible intent. Pity about the execution. What are they planning to do? \n The proposal is to have a separate scheme* for ECRs (perhaps around 200 projects) and a new scheme for mid-to-late career researchers(LCR). So we will have three experience groups in mainly different pools - ECRs, LCRs and the rest. \n *ECRs and LCRs can still apply in the general pool as well. \n The problems \n 1. How will they control the total allocation to ECRs? \n Why are they choosing 200 ECR projects? (This figure was mentioned in the ARC road-show and is not in the document) A fixed number of 200 awarded grants does not guarantee any particular success rate.\u00a0So perhaps they will target equal success rates for the three groups, otherwise why bother? This raises the really important question: \n What will they do if they get 2500 ECR proposals? Fund 500 of them? Which leaves 500 for the rest of the sector? What if only 200 apply?! \n 2. Gender bias\u00a0is not actually addressed.\u00a0 \n Have a look at the Figure again, reproduced below. If the ARC carried their idea to its logical conclusion they could create separate pools for each of the 7 experience categories and impose an equal success rate on each. This would get rid of the \u201cexperience bias\u201d completely but the gender bias remains completely unaddressed. Females ECRs still do worse than Male ECRs, even if they might do better than Male LCRs. \n \n They could even impose a higher success rate on ECR\u2019s and a decreasing success rate with more experience. This is of course perverse but it could be tuned in such a way that the overall success rates for females could be made to equal that of males. But the bias within experience groups would remain!!! Amongst ECR\u2019s the 4% success rate gap would not change. \n This is dangerously ignorant and thoughtless policy. Positive discrimination in favour of ECRs does not remove gender discrimination. It actually tries to hide it. \n As a tax payer I expect\u00a0the ARC to address the real issue. The real issue is that they have identified gender differences in success rates for all programs, but have not addressed the reason at all. \n Looking at gender bias \n It is possible that the quality of the applications for females was poorer and that this explains the lower success rate. This is not as fanciful as it may sound. Any kind of affirmative action at earlier career levels would result in the pool of female graduates being less capable than male graduates. And low success rates would not then\u00a0imply bias. On the other hand, it might be that female applications are even better than male applications and the aggregate figures under-estimate the true level of gender bias. We just do not know yet. And we should know. \n I believe that the ARC are ethically required to identify the extent of gender bias in their processes. A company with a poor safety record cannot ignore it. They are required to identify the sources of excess risk and eliminate them. In the same way, the ARC must properly assess the level and nature of gender bias, so as to remove it. \n This is not impossible to do. For instance, one might take all 2009 applications, strip them of gender identifying information, and then rate the quality of the proposal, and the experience of the applicants. One can then measure the extent of different success rates for genders after accounting for the quality of the proposal and researchers. \n The bottom line \n So the net effect of the proposed changes will be to \n \n divert funds from higher quality projects to lower quality and riskier projects of ECRs \n incentivize fresh PhD\u2019s to apply for their own grants rather than apply for post-docs under the supervision of a mentor \n totally ignore the issue of gender bias, in terms of checking whether it is really there, identifying the source or trying to correct it. \n \n What can be done about this? \n Perhaps not much.\u00a0Margaret Shiels writes in her foreward \n We are confident in the broad directions of change indicated in this paper, but would especially welcome commentary about details and implementation . \n Translation.

Kerry-Ann Walsh (former Herald-Sun journalist, now semi-retired and occasional opinion writer for Fairfax) chimed in with \n Given what Australia\u2019s needs are going into the future\u2026and the fact that the fertility rate is so low, we will just disappear if we don\u2019t have a healthy immigration level. \n \n And the fact that both sides were blathering during the election campaign and trying to hoodwink the Australian people is a disgrace. \n \n The suggestion that the Australian population is about to disappear is fanciful. It is about as wrong as anything can be in politics \u2013 it is arithmetically wrong. This is not a matter of opinion. I have run a few calculations and projections to illustrate the point. Other people might get slightly different answers depending on various assumptions, such as the exact age distribution of mothers and how mortality will progress in the future. \n TFR is the total fertility rate - meaning the number of children on average a women will have (supposing\u00a0she does not die before\u00a0having them). A value slight above 2 (in our case about 2.07) corresponds to replacement i.e. zero population growth. The history of the TFR in Australia is HERE. The TFR in Australia right now is about 1.97. The lowest it ever reached was 1.73 in 2001. In Hong Kong the TFR is about 0.9, see the ladder HERE . \n The projections below all assume zero net overseas migration (i.e. about 220,000 migrants to balance the 220,000 permanent departures each year), starting from a population of about 22.1 million at the beginning of 2010. \n \n \n \n \u00a0 \n TFR \n 2130 \n 2050 \n \n \n ZPG \n 2.07 \n 24.5 \n 25.4 \n \n \n Now \n 1.97 \n 24.2 \n 24.6 \n \n \n Lowest ever \n 1.73 \n 23.5 \n 22.9 \n \n \n Hong Kong \n 0.9 \n 20.9 \n 17.4 \n \n \n \n It doesn\u2019t really look like we are going to \u201cdisappear\u201d does it, even under the worst case 1.73 scenario. Under this scenario the population will still be higher than it is now in 2050! I am afraid that it is journalists who are hoodwinking the Australian people on this issue, not the politicians. \n Here is another scenario to consider. Suppose that drop the baby bonus and\u00a0that the TFR falls back to about 1.80 in response. Suppose that\u00a0we also reduced net overseas migration to 100,000 per year (instead of 200,000 which is now talked about as a compromise figure). Under these two policies - which represent the extreme of what would be politically possible in terms of reducing population pressure -\u00a0\u00a0does the population stagnate? No. It increases to 28.7 million in 2050 and continues to grow into the future. \n There are reasons for running an immigration policy, but saving us from a seriously declining total population is not one of them.

He is allowed to assume that the indefinite integral of x k is (k+1) -1 x k+1\u00a0 but he is not allowed to assume basic expansion formulas. \n You might think this is because of the word \u201cshow\u201d in the question \u2013 that a high standard of pedantry is required. Not so. Later in the exam, we are asked to find the mean of the same distribution.\u00a0We are again integrating a polynomial. A mark is again subtracted for not multiplying out the expression in the integrand. You can imagine that a student with a modicum of intelligence would, on receiving his marked script, be pretty angry and demotiviated with the subject of math methods. \n But it gets way, way worse.

The slides are HERE . The most important part of this post is the last section. I would be very grateful to have some ideas on the questions I pose there.) \n There are plenty of public intellectuals that are prominent in commenting on issues that directly inform public policy. The best known are probably Tim Flannery and Peter Singer. Another is Ross Garnaut who is routinely asked for comment on any issues that relate to climate change and resource rent taxes. Historians Henry Reynolds, Keith Windshuttle and Robert Manne are well-known for their internecine battles that have become milestones in the so-called history wars. Andrew Leigh (now the federal member for Fraser) and Joshue Gans are economist who write opinion pieces or appear on ABC radio on a weekly basis. There is not a single academic statistician or data analysts that contributes regularly to public debate. Why? \n \n First, I wanted to\u00a0point out\u00a0that not all public policy issues are ones where expert academics will carry the day. There is no way that an expert can convince you logically that gay marriage should be legalized. This is a value judgment. Public issues differ in many ways but one critical dimensions is the extent to which they depend on objective and quantifiable facts rather than subjective values. Peter Singer mainly lives down the value-laden end of the spectrum. Experts like him can still make a big contribution to debate on value dependent issues but their contribution is nor decisive. \n At the other extreme are issues which depend critically on objective and quantifiable facts, usually embodied in a set of numbers. They final decision may also depend on values but only after you know the numbers. The empirical evidence may be biased in various ways and perhaps cannot be taken at face value. This is where statisticians (and econometricians who currently inhabit this public space) can be immensely helpful. Once the facts have been objectively assessed, public debate can move on to values and trade offs. \n I thought I would list a few examples of where objective, expert assessment could have been very helpful to public discourse. \n Did Rudd\u2019s\u00a0stimulus work? \n The Rudd government spent about b$10.4 in discretionary stimulus spending in 2009. Many other countries also applied stimulus packages of varying size. So the question becomes \n Did those countries that applied larger stimuli see a better economic outcome, after adjusting for other relevant variables? \n Treasury had a go at this question and used IMF data on stimulus and GDP growth to produce a significant regression for 11 countries including Australia, see their 2010 budget statement papers #2 . The selection of these 11 countries was criticised by an RMIT economist and treasury were publically accused of selective use of statistics and data snooping. \n Statisticians would have a lot to add to this debate. We could use cluster analysis or other methods to select peer countries for Australia, we could include control variables in the regression and, most importantly, we could try to stand above the adversarial political environment that the issue was discussed in. \n How many died in Iraq? \n In 2006, a study published in the Lancet estimated that 655,000 people in Iraq were dead who would not have been dead if the war had not been prosecuted. Not surprisingly, the issue was immediately politicised . The gory details of the sampling and methodology used were never going to get a full airing in the media, so it degenerated into a \u201cwho do you believe\u201d issue. \n Casualties in war zones are difficult to count because of the chaos on the ground and the lack of centralised government infrastructure. The Lancet study used a sampling method known as multi-stage cluster sampling . They used a log-linear model to estimate the excess number of deaths. If this is not an issue where statistical experts could contribute to public debate, then I don\u2019t know what is. \n I had a close look at the Lancet paper myself and find that it is lacking in important, indeed to my mind essential,\u00a0detail. The exact protocol for selecting the cluster of houses is not given and bearing in mind the potential for contamination and bias of reported deaths this is a huge issue. The details of the statistical model fitted are also lacking, though I am\u00a0advised by people in this area that the severe space restrictions imposed in large prestigious journals means that minor details like how you analysed the data (!) are often omitted. On the basis of about a full day of reading and thinking, I came to\u00a0the view that the\u00a0paper should not have been published without much more detail. For an issue of this import, the Lancet should just devote a few more pages of their journal! That is not to say the 655000 figure was wrong, nor that the research was necessarily unsound. But the published paper was not sufficiently transparent that it could be properly assessed by the peer community (or by me). \n The population of Australia. \n This is an issue that is of continuing interest. About 10 years ago Peter Costello was telling us we need to have more babies while in the most recent election both parties were saying they wanted a smaller population (though neither had a credible plan to achieve this). The issues with population are (1) total population and its effect on infrastructure and the natural environment, (2) the age distribution and how it affects GDP per head, and (3) cultural diversity. \n You would think that demographic projections would be uncontroversial enough that the facts could be on the public table and there would be some consequent consistency on public policy and discourse. For the Belz lecture, I ran a few projections of my own. I am not convinced that statisticians should get into the third issue of cultural diversity. It is too difficult to measure (apart from silly measures such as the mean number of Australian ancestors people have) and whether you consider diversity a good thing, a bad thing, or something that is optimised in the middle, which\u00a0is mainly a value judgment. \n So I just focused on total population and various age dependency ratios. I measured dependency ratios in terms of an equivalent retirement age (ERA) to maintain ratios at 2010 levels (which I think might be novel?). At the end of the day, I came up with three propositions which I think all demographers would confirm and which have some pretty obvious implications. \n First, the population is set to age drastically over the next 30 years. This is a consequence of having fertility rates of 3.5. post war and then changing to fertility rates lower than 2. It is largely inevitable , and we would be better off debating how we are going to cope. Encouraging later retirement and savings rates are pretty obvious starters. Second, to the extent that we can affect the number of workers per elderly person, either higher fertility or migration is equally effective. And we can only reduce the ERA from 73 (which is where it will be in 2050 with zero population growth) to maybe around 71. Thirdly, if one includes the youngest age group of 0-15 as dependents as well as the retired, then the ERA can be somewhat reduced by a combination of lower fertility rates and higher immigration. The reason is that fertility injects babies into the population who have to be fed and educated for 15 years whereas immigrants tend to be overwhelmingly in the more productive age ranges. Low fertility and highish immigration was pretty much where we were 10 years ago before politicians started suggesting that the aging population was a problem that could be fixed by financial inducements. \n \u2026.There were several other public issues that I could have discussed in the talk but didn\u2019t. Did Howard\u2019s gun buy-back have an effect on homicide and suicide rates? How should we measure the performance of schools? Does prison reduce crime? How much fo the falling road toll is due to random breath testing. Should the legal limit be further reduced or have we already hit diminishing returns? And let\u2019s not forget that endangered polar bear in the room climate change.\u00a0 \n How can we be involved? \n There is\u00a0nothing to stop individuals becoming regular media contributors on statistical issues, in the same way that Andrew Leigh and Joshua Gans do. The problem is that there is no incentive to do so, especially for young academics. Andrew Leigh was able to rise to ANU Professor based on innovative and careful empirical econometrics. I do not believe that statisticians can do the same. There is a cultural bias amongst us mathematical types\u00a0against applied as opposed to methodological\u00a0or fundamental research. \n I wonder then whether we might consider setting up some kind of panel of experts. The advantages of this are (1) The authority of a panel. The public are already familiar with letters signed by panels of experts. The idea is that the political biases in such statements have been largely excised through\u00a0the process of getting unanimous panel agreement, (2) Closely related to this is that critical analysis from many heads is likely to lead to a more reliably assessment than that of an individual. Personally, I would be pretty nervous about publically pronouncing on the Iraq body count without the robust input of my peers.\u00a0(3) The workload can also be spread across several people. I envisage that perhaps one member of the panel would write the report, and then have it critically examined by the others."], "link": "http://blogs.mbs.edu/fishing-in-the-bay/?p=255", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.imf.org/": 1, "http://www.gov.au/": 1, "http://www.com.au/": 1, "http://catallaxyfiles.com/": 1, "http://www.joshuagans.com/": 1, "http://www.andrewleigh.com/blog": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://blogs.mbs.edu/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Fishing in the Bay"}]
