The article, Doc, What Are My Chances? , can be freely downloaded from the Modern Nomograms webpage, which also offers commercial posters of the two nomograms used to calculate Bayes\u2019 Theorem (one for common cases and one optimized for calculating rare cases). \n Bayes\u2019 Theorem is a statistical technique that calculates a final posttest probability based on an initial pretest probability and the results of a test of a given discriminating power. Thomas Bayes (1701-1761) first suggested this method, and Pierre-Simon Laplace published it in its modern form in 1812. It has generated quite a bit of controversy from frequentists (who work from a null hypothesis rather than an initial posited probability), but this technique has become much more popular in modern times. \n Among many other applications, this is a common technique used in evidence-based medicine, in which statistical methods are used to analyze the results of diagnostic tests. For example, a diagnostic test might have a sensitivity of 98%, or in other words, the test will return a positive result 98% of the time for a person having that disease. It might have a specificity of 95%, which means it will return a negative result 95% of the time for a person who does not have the disease. For a disease that has a prevalence (a pretest probability) of 1% in the general population, Bayes\u2019 Theorem provides, say, the probability of a person having the disease with a positive test result. Pretty darn likely, right? Well, it turns out it\u2019s about 16% because the false positives from the 99% who do not have the disease overwhelm the true positives from the 1% who have it. This is the basis for recent recommendations to stop PSA screening in men, for example, as expensive and counterproductive. But all this is described in detail in the article.

This effect had been noticed in mostly wooden ships for centuries, and broad attempts to minimize it were implemented. But the advent of ships with iron hulls and steam engines in the early 1800s created a real crisis. A mathematical formulation of the deviation for all compass courses and locations at sea was needed in order to understand and compensate for it, and Smith became the preeminent expert in this sphere of activity. With Capt. Frederick J. Evans he extended his mathematical treatment to detailed procedures for measuring the magnetic parameters for a ship, and he also invented graphical methods for quickly calculating the magnetic deviation for any ship\u2019s course once these parameters were found, constructions called dynamo-gonio-grams (force-angle diagrams), or dygograms for short. \n Today, radio navigational systems such as LORAN and GPS, and inertial navigation systems with ring and fiber-optic gyros, gyrocompasses and the like have reduced the use of a ship\u2019s compass to worst-case scenarios.

Beyond this, a brief knowledge of determinants offers a powerful way of designing very elegant and sophisticated nomograms. A few basics of determinants are presented here that require no previous knowledge of them, and their use in the\u00a0construction of straight line nomograms is demonstrated. Then we will see how these determinants can be manipulated to create extraordinary nomograms. \n (more\u2026)"], "link": "http://myreckonings.com/wordpress/2008/01/09/the-art-of-nomography-ii-designing-with-determinants/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://myreckonings.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Dead Reckonings"}, {"content": ["Nomography, truly a forgotten art, is the graphical representation of mathematical relationships or laws (the Greek word for law is nomos ). These graphs are variously called nomograms (the term used here), nomographs , alignment charts , and abacs . This area of practical and theoretical mathematics was invented in 1880 by Philbert Maurice d\u2019Ocagne (1862-1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. \n Along with the mathematics involved, a great deal of ingenuity went into the design of these nomograms to increase their utility as well as their precision. Many books were written on nomography and then driven out of print with the spread of computers and calculators, and it can be difficult to find these books today even in libraries.

Most modern \u201cpendulum\u201d clocks simply drive the pendulum to provide a historical look, but a great deal of ingenuity originally went into their design in order to produce highly accurate clocks. This essay explores horologic design efforts that were so important at one time\u2014not gearwork, winding mechanisms, crutches or escapements (which may appear as later essays), but the surprising inventiveness found in the \u201csimple\u201d pendulum itself. \n It is commonly known that Galileo (1564-1642) discovered that a swinging weight exhibits isochronism , purportedly by noticing that chandeliers in the Pisa cathedral had identical periods despite the amplitudes of their swings. The advantage here is that the driving force for the pendulum, which is difficult to regulate, could vary without affecting its period. Galileo was a medical student in Pisa at the time and began using it to check patients\u2019 pulse rates. \n Galileo later established that the period of a pendulum varies as the square root of its length and is independent of the material of the pendulum bob (the mass at the end). One thing that surprised me when I encountered it is that the escapement preceded the pendulum\u2014the verge escapement was used with hanging weights and possibly water clocks from at least the 14th century and probably much earlier. The pendulum provided a means of regulating such an escapement, and in fact Galileo invented the pin-wheel escapement to use in a pendulum clock he designed but never built. But it took the work of others to design pendulums for truly accurate clocks, and here we consider the contributions of three of these: Christiaan Huygens, George Graham and John Harrison. \n (more\u2026)"], "link": "http://myreckonings.com/wordpress/2007/11/19/the-not-so-simple-pendulum/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://myreckonings.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Dead Reckonings"}, {"content": ["Have you ever had to calculate the positions of astronomical objects? Orbital calculations relative to an observer on the Earth require derivations and time-consuming solutions of spherical trigonometric equations.
