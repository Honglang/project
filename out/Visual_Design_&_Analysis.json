Plus we\u2019re from an intelligence community background. \n We know we\u2019re setting ourselves up for a fall. \u00a0When we do something dumb, as we inevitably will at some point, people will laugh and say \u2018not so intelligent now, are you?\u2019 \u00a0But hey, one has to start somewhere! \n So what is the product and the opportunity? \n Lots of visualisation systems are kind of old-fashioned. Remember the days when you had to get a CD in the mail before installing new software? \u00a0Now you get a download link instead, but there are still a lot of problems with any approach that needs an install. \u00a0Desktop software creates problems for enterprises. \u00a0Desktop software has a massive total cost of ownership. \u00a0It is far cheaper and easier to deploy an web application from a server and make it available to hundreds of people directly. \n Most apps in enterprises are already deployed wholly in the browser. \u00a0But visualisation systems remain stubbornly desktop based. Vendors often claim that access to the local machine is necessary for performance reasons. \n With the power of current browsers, that position is no longer sustainable. \n Our first product is called KeyLines . \n KeyLines is a commercial strength software development kit for visualising network data in your browser. It is designed to fit into your Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). \n Lots of developers are either just starting out in JavaScript, or don\u2019t want to make the transition from strongly typed languages like Java & .NET, where they are comfortable with their choices and have great tool support. \u00a0And many more developers don\u2019t have experience of developing graphical applications. \n These developers can pick up KeyLines, and with a minimal amount of JavaScript they can have a graphical component embedded in their web application. \u00a0KeyLines handles all the rendering code & event handling. \u00a0The developer decides what data should be shown and how. \n KeyLines works everywhere in the enterprise \u2013 even on old machines running IE \u2013 as well as the CEO\u2019s beloved iPad \n Developers can keep their server-stack the same: KeyLines is agnostic about where the data comes from. \n Development managers and system integrators will be happy too: their development costs can keep low. \u00a0The last thing they need is an over-confident developer who spends a year developing something that it would be easier to just buy in. \u00a0And the visualization part will be supported on proper commercial terms, long after the development team has moved on to other things. \n KeyLines can be used anywhere where understanding networks is important . \u00a0I.e., anywhere\u00a0one can get business value from looking and analysing them. \n So. That is the theory. Time will tell if we are right.. \n Contact us if you want to learn more!"], "link": "http://www.joeparry.com/blog/?p=481", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://cambridge-intelligence.com": 1, "http://key-lines.com/": 3, "http://key-lines.com": 1}, "blogtitle": "Visual Design & Analysis"}, {"content": ["In January 2011 I resigned from my safe cushy job. Security blanket discarded, I\u00a0read lots of start-up books & met lots of business people. I decided to start a company. After a bit of bureaucratic admin, I began to assemble a team, a group of suppliers for things that could be outsourced & a network of business mentors and advisors.\u00a0Thanks to the friendly folks at ideaSpace \u00a0the company now has an office in a great location alongside a great bunch of other start-ups. \n Meanwhile and throughout the year I wrote a shed load of code. I abandoned Python (temporarily?) and threw myself into JavaScript both client-side and server-side, embracing nodeJS and many other projects. The vibrancy, diversity and downright helpfulness of the people in the JS community has been massively galvanizing. \n Alongside the coding I started the hunt for a lead customer \u2013 someone who\u2019d value the ideals of the company and benefit from the growing code-base. Following some good fortune, we found an opportunity. After a long negotiation we signed the deal to our mutual interests and delivery began in earnest. Having people bash, prod and break things, together with suggesting feature after feature has been incredibly useful. We couldn\u2019t have asked for better partners. And in December we completed the first part of the contract successfully. \n I\u2019ve been blown away by the enthusiasm friends have for the venture and the wholehearted support of my family. I didn\u2019t predict how much I\u2019d learn about my own character, flaws and all. I\u2019ve made some mistakes, sure, but nothing I can\u2019t back out of later on. \n It has been an amazing year, but the real test is coming in 2012. Can we build a brand and repeat the business model? What else can we make and how can we sell it? What will happen when the product enters the public domain? A collective shrug of the shoulders or a genuine pipeline of customers? \n With these questions and many more, it is challenging to work out which are the important ones and which should be tackled first. I never expected this seemingly perpetual uncertainty. Nor the constant testing of one\u2019s abilities in unfamiliar situations.

I\u2019ve seen the company grow from 30 to about 300 people. I\u2019ve worked for three line managers, under three CTOs. I\u2019ve moved desks eight times. \u00a0Since I joined there have been five major versions of Windows. I\u2019ve managed six different people. I\u2019ve had five different roles.

I\u2019ve stopped using any Microsoft tools. \u00a0I\u2019m really not a big fan of heavy \u2018enterprise\u2019 frameworks, but prefer a lighter, quicker way.

One thing I loved about it was the mapping of street terms to abstract network structures \u2013 \u2018payback\u2019 = reciprocity, \u2018untouchables\u2019 = high out-degree, low in-degree, etc. \n Jamie F Olson talked about the statistical properties of centrality measures of communication networks over time. I didn\u2019t quite grok the talk but the gist was that by varying the time-window size and comparing centralities across time periods it is possible to identify the \u2018best\u2019 sampling window for the network. For example, he showed that a week was a good period to sample some email data. Apparently a preprint may be available soon on his personal page \u2013 I\u2019ll be looking out for that! \n Ulrik Brandes (with\u00a0 Bobo Nick ) gave a\u00a0beautifully crafted visualisation design paper. They used Gestalt principles to put together sparklines-inspired glyph for showing network dynamics. \u00a0Very elegant. \n Elisha Peterson had some smart ideas for keeping node positions\u00a0stable in visualisations of dynamic networks. He did this by putting springs between versions same node across the time slices (before & after). It seemed to make things more stable at the expense of some calculational complexity. \n Lin Freeman shared his insights on the many ways of finding cohesive sub-groups in networks. He gave a clear and concise history of various methods from social sciences, maths & physics. Then an outline of measures of success (modularity q, EI conductance, Freeman Segregation index, Pearson\u2019s correlation ratio) before running the algorithms over a collection of data sets. \u00a0Success depends not only on the algorithm but also of course on the cohesiveness of the data. Conclusion? \u00a0Good: \u00a0Correspondance Analysis, Leading Eigenvector, WalkTrap, Fast Greedy. Not so good: Factions, Tabu, others. \u00a0I hope this work gets written up in a review paper soon. \n Mark Lauchs talked about the networks involved in a massive police corruption case in Queensland, Australia that were exposed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry . This talk demonstrated that it probable that \u2018dark networks\u2019 can never be found automatically: the bad cops were structurally similar to the good cops. The only practical way of uncovering the network inside is\u00a0to identify at least one bad egg, and use network structures to\u00a0work from there to get the wider picture. \n Joshua Marineau had some interesting insight into the benefit of negative ties within an organisation. \u00a0Although it has been shown that individuals who have negative ties\u00a0under-perform, he claimed that being positively connected to someone who themselves have negative ties can actually be an advantage. \n \n \n The legendary hospitality suite was as friendly as ever too"], "link": "http://www.joeparry.com/blog/?p=437", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.usma.edu/": 1, "http://joshmarineau.com/": 1, "http://www.umass.edu/": 1, "http://www.uni-konstanz.de/": 2, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1, "http://www.harvard.edu/": 1, "http://www.edu.au/": 1, "http://www.gov.au/": 1, "http://www.cmu.edu/": 1, "http://www.papachristos.org/": 1, "http://moreno.uci.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Visual Design & Analysis"}, {"content": ["This diagram is absolutely fascinating. \n  \n  \n It comes from Easley & Kleinberg\u2019s new book from an excellent paper by Crandall et al (2008) ( pdf ). \n It is a sort of anatomy of how links between people are created: it tries to capture the birth moment and the forces before and after it. \n The upward curve is\u00a0intriguing\u00a0but straightforward to explain by homophily \u2013 like seeking like. \n The most interesting bit is the curve just before the first communication occurs. \u00a0People get suddenly more similar \u2013 a kind of gravitational attraction occurs in the affiliation network and the first communication is sparked into life, closing the triads. \n Although is tempting to explain this by creating physics based models, as the paper does, \u00a0I can\u2019t help feeling there is a simpler explaination. \u00a0 I would guess that the base of the curve is generally where \u2018awareness\u2019 happens. \u00a0At this moment the editors become aware of each other, and at that point a basic psychological effect takes over: simple curiosity .

Typically time runs bottom to top in these diagrams and observers are plotted as lines. \n \n This well-crafted musical visualization (pdf) from Jon Snydal & Marty Hearst has pitch as proximity, and the lines show structural patterns as the motif is repeated with variations: \n  \n A few years ago, the BBC ran a programme about comedy heroes which I remembered for the credits and title sequences. \u00a0They show the interweaving careers of British comedians over the decades. \n \n Here proximity represents collaboration on a TV program. \n The wonderful JunkCharts blog showed this timeline narrative of Wall Street Bank acquisitions: \n  \n And finally, a few years ago in the day job we put together a system for drawing out diagrams that can convey meetings and assignations: \n \n What are the aesthetic and legibility rules that govern these kind of diagrams? \u00a0Are there rules similar to graph drawing aesthetics? \n I think there are some guidelines. \n \n Meetings, significant events, etc. can be shown as joining lines: most of the narrative power comes out of this simple drawing metaphor. \n Other line crossings are to be avoided. \n When they can\u2019t be avoided, \u00a0use a good visual design to allow the eye to follow what is going on. \n Make sure the line labels are legible across the diagram. \u00a0It isn\u2019t any good just labelling the left side because by the time one has scrolled over to the right the labels will be out of view. \u00a0On a static picture this means repeating the label as in the xkcd example. Also consider labelling the right hand side too. \n Colour is good for categories of persona. \n Colour plays an important role in helping your eye distinguish between lines. \n Thick lines are easier on the eye than thin ones. \n Curved lines are preferable to straight lines \u2013 they are just easier to follow. \n Lines can start late and end early. \u00a0If that line is a character in a movie, abrubt termination means the worst has happened \n Line style can change as the story evolves and you can use this for narrative effect. In the xkcd Jurassic Park example, the dotted line shows a velociraptor is in prison. \n Parallel lines work really well. \n \n Perhaps the least talked about point in Manuel Lima\u2019s manifesto was \u2018Embrace Time\u2019. \u00a0I agree with Manuel that we should be working on this and it would be great to see more effort in this area."], "link": "http://www.joeparry.com/blog/?p=204", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.visualcomplexity.com/": 1, "http://www.offhanddesigns.com/": 2, "http://xkcd.com/": 2, "http://www.metaportaldermedienpolemik.net/blog": 1, "http://junkcharts.typepad.com/": 2, "http://www.co.uk/": 1, "http://danielmclaren.net/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Visual Design & Analysis"}]
