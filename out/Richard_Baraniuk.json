Baraniuk, \u201c CS-MUVI: Video Compressive Sensing for Spatial-Multiplexing Cameras \u201c, IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography, Seattle, WA, April, 2012. \n Abstract:\u00a0 Compressive sensing (CS)-based spatial-multiplexing cameras (SMCs) sample a scene through a series of coded projections using a spatial light modulator and a few optical sensor elements. SMC architectures are particularly useful when imaging at wavelengths for which full-frame sensors are too cumbersome or expensive. While existing recovery algorithms for SMCs perform well for static images, they typically fail for time-varying scenes (videos). In this paper, we propose a novel CS multi-scale video (CS-MUVI) sensing and recovery framework for SMCs. Our framework features a co-designed video CS sensing matrix and recovery algorithm that provide an efficiently computable low-resolution video preview. We estimate the scene\u2019s optical flow from the video preview and feed it into a convex-optimization algorithm to recover the high-resolution video. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the CS-MUVI framework for different scenes. \n The CS-MUVI concept:\u00a0 The key challenge with sensing videos with cameras such as the single pixel camera (SPC) is that the scene changes with every compressive measurement obtained. Traditional L1-recovery methods fail in the presence of rapid motion. We circumvent this problem by designing special measurement matrices that enable a two-step recovery process; the first step is to estimate motion in the scene and the second step is to recover the scene in full spatial and temporal resolution. \n CS-MUVI project page \n CS-MUVI demo video"], "link": "http://web.ece.rice.edu/richb/2012/04/08/video-compressive-sensing-via-cs-muvi/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://web.rice.edu/": 1, "http://dsp.rice.edu/": 2, "http://www.youtube.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Richard Baraniuk"}, {"content": ["Welcome to Open Educational Resources (OER) Week!\u00a0 The Connexions and OpenStax College teams will be speaking several times this week about our recent progress on free, open-source textbooks. \n \n OpenStax College \n Connexions"], "link": "http://web.ece.rice.edu/richb/2012/03/05/oer-week-5-10-march-2012/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://web.rice.edu/": 1, "http://openstaxcollege.org": 1, "http://cnx.org": 1}, "blogtitle": "Richard Baraniuk"}, {"content": ["C. Hegde and R. G. Baraniuk, \u201c Signal Recovery on Incoherent Manifolds ,\u201d preprint, February 2012. \n Abstract:\u00a0 Suppose that we observe noisy linear measurements of an unknown signal that can be modeled as the sum of two component signals, each of which arises from a nonlinear sub-manifold of a high-dimensional ambient space. We introduce Successive Projections onto INcoherent manifolds (SPIN), a first-order projected gradient method to recover the signal components. Despite the nonconvex nature of the recovery problem and the possibility of underdetermined measurements, SPIN provably recovers the signal components, provided that the signal manifolds are incoherent and that the measurement operator satisfies a certain restricted isometry property. SPIN significantly extends the scope of current recovery models and algorithms for low-dimensional linear inverse problems and matches (or exceeds) the current state-of-the-art in terms of performance. \n  \n The above example illustrates SPIN recovery of two manifold-modeled components from compressive measurements of a noisy N =64\u00d764 image.\u00a0 The clean image consists of the linear superposition of a disk and square of fixed sizes but unknown locations.
