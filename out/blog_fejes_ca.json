(Thank goodness my daughter is sleeping well, finally!) \n The second is that my family has been making some big decisions. \u00a0The biggest of the bunch is that we\u2019ll be returning to North America. \u00a0Denmark hasn\u2019t worked out for us, and this is really the only logical decision we could make. \u00a0Our original timeline was for three years in Denmark, but we\u2019ll be cutting it down to one year. \n Yes, that does mean I\u2019m officially looking for a new job for the start of 2013, either in Vancouver or San Francisco \u2013 the two places that my family would be happiest. \u00a0If anyone knows of a company looking to hire a bioinformatician with experience in Next-gen sequencing in either of those cities, please let me know! \u00a0As I\u2019ve discussed with my employer, I\u2019ll be working in Denmark until the end of the year, but will be available in January. \n For the moment, I\u2019m making arrangements to do a post-doc, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really a step forward for my career. \n As for why things haven\u2019t worked out here, I think it\u2019s a combination of a lot of factors, but most obvious is that Denmark is really a hard country to find your way in. \u00a0The language is challenging, and with a young child, we haven\u2019t been able to dedicate the time to the intensive language classes that are available, and we also haven\u2019t been able to really find a social network that comes close to replacing the ones we\u2019d left behind in Canada. \u00a0With our closest family members being a minimum of 18 hours away by plane, this just isn\u2019t working well for us given that we have a young child. \n Of course, there are other factors, ranging from the trivial (and silly) to complex, which include (in no particular order): \n \n Accessibility (it\u2019s much harder to get around in Denmark with a young child, compared to North America, particularly since Canadians can not get a driver\u2019s licence here) \n Availability (We\u2019re forced to order from UK or further away to buy many of the products we need/want for our child because they\u2019re just not available in Denmark.) \n Comfort issues (Denmark doesn\u2019t believe in bathtubs, for instance, and I haven\u2019t had a shower in Denmark that didn\u2019t involve either frozen toes or scalding blasts of hot water since arriving), \n Pets health (still haven\u2019t found a replacement food for the cat after searching for half a year) \n Community (Everything shuts down on Sundays, which is devastating when you\u2019re living in a \u201csmall\u201d town and only have a handful of friends.) \n \n All in all, however, I think these are simply things we take for granted in North America, and \u00a0a year in Denmark has been an expensive education in recognizing how differently Europeans and North Americans see the world. \n Thus, I\u2019ll be returning to North America with a lot more life experience and hoping that someone out there will want to put it to good use."], "link": "http://blog.fejes.ca/?p=2250", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "blog.fejes.ca"}, {"content": ["Just came across this article on parental leave in Sweden. \u00a0After experiencing the Danish version, I figured I\u2019d just post this to contrast how one\u00a0Scandinavian\u00a0country differs from another: \u00a0 For Paternity Leave, Sweden Asks if Two Months is Enough ."], "link": "http://blog.fejes.ca/?p=2247", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://online.wsj.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "blog.fejes.ca"}, {"content": ["A friend of mine asked me to distribute this. \u00a0It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve posted anything bioinformatics related, but if you\u2019re looking for a bioinformatics post doc position in a beautiful location, this one sounds pretty good. \u00a0Yes, I used my danish keyboard to obfuscate the email address\u2026 shouldn\u2019t be too hard to figure out, for those who aspire to be post docs.

It\u2019s a shame \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty town, and I\u2019ve even discovered that cruise ships dock here, but they\u2019re making life difficult for their own citizens and throwing away tourism dollars as people with young children or disabilities will struggle to navigate the streets.\u00a0 What a shame."], "link": "http://blog.fejes.ca/?p=2228", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "blog.fejes.ca"}, {"content": ["One of the more interesting things about living in a foreign country is that you have an opportunity to gain a new perspective on your environment.\u00a0 Living outside your comfort zone either drives you nuts, or into a completely new way of looking at things.\u00a0 That is, you adapt or you run. \n In the first few months, you spend so much of your time just trying to get your bearings that you don\u2019t really see past the challenges.\u00a0 Learning a new language, figuring out how the bank works, dealing with the little details of life.\u00a0 All of that occupies all of your brain power. \n Somewhere along the line, you start to see past the frustrations and start to get into a routine.\u00a0 You know what to buy at the store, how to take the bus and maybe know a few of the customs \u2013 what to say and what not to say to your colleagues. \n Eventually, you start to gain an understanding of the people\u2026 well, maybe not, but you get a sense of what\u2019s important to them \u2013 and you can contrast that with what\u2019s important to you: finally, a sense of perspective. \n Most curiously, after all this time, what I find interesting, at this phase of insight, is that Danes don\u2019t share the same sense of progress as North Americans.\u00a0 The goal of \u201cgetting ahead\u201d just doesn\u2019t seem to be a driving force.\u00a0 In Canada, we spend a lot of time saving up for retirement, planning our future, looking for ways to get ahead in our respective careers and all that jazz.\u00a0 In Denmark, people are happy with where they are, they look for a comfortable job, a nice (ridiculously expensive) car, and probably 3 kids. \n Most likely it\u2019s because income equality is so flat \u2013 you\u2019re not going to make a whole lot more by climbing the corporate ladder (unless you\u2019re really high up in the company, I suspect). \n And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2013 it\u2019s just different.
