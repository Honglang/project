Turning some wild concept that sprung from the minds of a bunch of scientists into a working artifact is a huge rush, and I can only smile as people from around the world commence tinkering with the thing, often in ways I never expected. The \u201cbuild it\u201d phase of a research project, besides being a ton of fun, inevitably sheds important light back on the original design in a virtuous cycle. \n In that vein, I am thrilled to announce the beta launch of PredictWiseQ , a fully operational example of our latest combinatorial prediction market design : \u201cA tractable combinatorial market maker using constraint generation\u201d , published in the 2012 ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce . \n You read the paper. 1 \u00a0Now play the game. 2 Help us close the loop. \n  \n PredictWiseQ is our greedy attempt to scarf up as much information as is humanly possible and use it, wisely, to forecast nearly every possible detail about the upcoming US presidential election. For example, we can project how likely it is that Romney will win Colorado but lose the election (6.2%), or that the same party will win both Ohio and Pennsylvania (77.6%), or that Obama will paint a path of blue from Canada to Mexico (99.5%). But don\u2019t just window shop, go ahead and customize and buy a prediction or ten for yourself. Your actions help inform the odds of your own predictions and, crucially, thousands of other related predictions at the same time. \n For example, a bet on Obama to win both Ohio and Florida can automatically raise his odds of winning Ohio alone. That\u2019s because our market maker knows and enforces the fact that Obama winning OH and FL can never be more likely than him winning OH. After every trade, we find and fix thousands of these logical inconsistencies. In other words, our market maker identifies and cleans up arbitrage wherever it finds it. But there\u2019s a limit to how fastidious our market maker can be. It\u2019s effectively impossible to rid the system of all arbitrage: doing so is NP-hard, or computationally intractable. So we clean up a good bit of arbitrage, but there should be plenty left. \n So here\u2019s a reader\u2019s challenge: try to identify arbitrage on PredictWiseQ that we did not . Go ahead and profit from it and, when you\u2019re ready, please let me and others know about it in the comments. I\u2019ll award kudos to the reader who finds the simplest arbitrage. \n Why not leave all \u00a0of the arbitrage for our traders to profit from themselves? That\u2019s what nearly every other market does, from Ireland-based Intrade , to Las Vegas bookmakers, to the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The reason is, we\u2019re operating a prediction market. Our goal is to elicit information. Even a completely uninformed trader can profit from arbitrage via a mechanical plug-and-chug process. We should reserve the spoils for people who provide good information, not those armed (solely) with fast or clever algorithms. Moreover, we want every little crumb of information that we get, in whatever form we get it, to immediately impact as many of the thousands or millions of predictions that it relates to as possible. We don\u2019t want to wait around for traders to perform this propagation on their own and, besides, it\u2019s a waste of their brain cells : it\u2019s a job much better suited for a computer anyway. \n Intrade offers an impressive array of predictions about the election, including who will win in all fifty states . In a sense, PredictWiseQ is Intrade to the 57th power . In a combinatorial market , a prediction can be any (Boolean) function of the state outcomes, an ungodly degree of flexibility. Let\u2019s do some counting. In the election, there are actually 57 \u201cstates\u201d: 48 winner-takes-all states, Washington DC, and two proportional states \u2014 Nebraska and Maine \u2014 that can split their electoral votes in 5 and 3 unique ways, respectively. Ignoring independent candidates, all 57 base \u201cstates\u201d can end up colored Democratic blue or Republican Red. So that\u2019s 2 to the power 57, or 144 quadrillion possible maps that newscasters might show us after the votes are tallied on November 6th. A prediction, like \u201cRomney wins Ohio\u201d, is the set of all outcomes where the prediction is true, in this case all 72 quadrillion maps where Ohio is red. The number of possible predictions is the number of sets of outcomes, or 2 to the power 144 quadrillion. That\u2019s more than a googol , though less than a googolplex (maybe next year). To get a sense of how big that is, if today\u2019s fastest supercomputer starting counting at the instant of the big bang, it still wouldn\u2019t be anywhere close reaching a googol yet . \n Create your own league to compare your political WiseQ among friends. If you tell us how much each player is in for, we\u2019ll tell you how to divvy things up at the end. Or join the \u201cFriends Of Dave\u201d (FOD) league . If you finish ahead of me in my league, I\u2019ll buy you a beer (or beverage of your choice) the next time I see you, or I\u2019ll paypal you $5 if we don\u2019t cross paths. \n PredictWiseQ is part of PredictWise , a fascinating startup of its own. Founded by my colleague David Rothschild , PredictWise is the place to go for thousands of accurate, real-time predictions on politics, sports, finance, and entertainment, aggregated and curated from around the web. The PredictWiseQ Game is a joint effort among David , Miro , Sebastien , Clinton , and myself . \n The academic paper that PredictWiseQ is based on is one of my favorites \u2014 owed in large part to my coauthors Miro and Sebastien , two incredible sciengineers. As is often the case, the theory looks bulletproof on paper. But I\u2019ve learned the hard way many times that you don\u2019t really know if a design is good until you try it. Or more accurately, until you build it and let a crowd of other people try it. \n So, dear crowd, please try it! Bang on it. Break it. (Though please tell me how you did, so we might fix it.) Tell me what you like and what is horribly wrong. Mostly, have fun playing a market that I believe represents the future of markets in the post-CDA era , a.k.a the digital age. \n __________ \n 1 Or not. \n 2 Or not."], "link": "http://blog.oddhead.com/2012/10/06/predictwiseq/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.sigecom.org/": 1, "http://www.linkedin.com/": 1, "http://intrade.com": 2, "http://www.harvard.edu/": 1, "http://www.predictwise.com/": 1, "http://PredictWise.com": 1, "http://bit.ly/": 1, "http://www.princeton.edu/": 4, "http://research.microsoft.com/": 2, "http://wiseq.predictwise.com/": 1, "http://dpennock.com/": 2, "http://researchdmr.com/": 2, "http://www.halfbakedlunatic.com/": 1, "http://blog.oddhead.com/": 4, "http://predictwiseq.com": 3}, "blogtitle": "Oddhead Blog"}, {"content": ["My blog has been hacked yet again . For those keeping track, that\u2019s infection number three. This latest exploit is very similar to the previous one . To humans arriving via browser (e.g., me), the site appears perfectly normal and healthy. Even upon clicking \u2018view source\u2019, nothing untoward is revealed. The <title> of my blog is, as always, Oddhead Blog . \n However, when Google\u2019s or Bing\u2019s crawlers arrive to index my corner of the web, they see a different <title> altogether \u2014 Buy Cheap Cialis Online\u00a0 \u2014 and immediately roll their eyes. (Actually even if you run 'curl http://blog.oddhead.com' , you\u2019ll see the spam keywords.) The effect of the attack is a kind of reverse cloaking . Cloaking is the black-hat SEO practice of serving legitimate content to crawlers and spam content to people. Here, the spam content is shown to the crawlers and the legitimate content to the people. \n Once the crawlers report this\u00a0appalling\u00a0information back to their respective mother ships, the search engines have no choice but to delist and demote my blog in their pagerankings. Right now, if you search for or within Oddhead Blog on Google, you\u2019ll see how poorly the bots in Mountain View think of me: \n \n You can hardly find any deep links into my blog by searching Google. For example, try searching for Bem+Wom , my invented term for \u201cBEtter Mousetrap, Word of Mouth\u201d . Even try \u201cBem+Wom oddhead blog\u201d . You\u201dll find aggregators republishing my content, but no links to the original source, my blog, anywhere in sight.

Clearly it\u2019s not to sell Cialis to my users, as they remain blissfully ignorant of any changes. The only benefit to anyone is to remove one relatively obscure blog from the search engine rankings and thus to move the attacker one slot up. Having a blog tangentially about gambling probably puts me into a shady neighborhood of the web, yet reverse-cloaking your competition (even if it can be somewhat automated and strike more than one competitor) seems like an awfully indirect way to improve one\u2019s standing in Google. It\u2019s also possible this is an act of pure vandalism. \n So what should I do? Although I partly blame WordPress for writing insecure software, I may end up paying WordPress protection money to make this problem go away. I am seriously considering giving up on self hosting and moving my whole operation to worpress.com\u2019s hosted service , where presumably security is tighter, or at least it\u2019s not my responsibility any more. My web hosting service, DreamHost, may also be partly to blame , yet I like the company and have been quite happy with them in many respects. Any advice, dear reader? WordPress.com? Blogger?

If that were all, I would be over-the-top happy right now. \n But that\u2019s not all. Together with fourteen other founding members (seven of whom I can name: Duncan Watts , John Langford , David Rothschild , Sharad Goel , Dan Goldstein , Jake Hofman , and Sid Suri ), we are cutting the ribbon on a new outpost for Microsoft Research in New York City. We will report to Jennifer Chayes, the founder and director of Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge, MA. It\u2019s been amazing to watch her up close pursue a goal relentlessly with boundless positive energy. I get the feeling it\u2019s how she approaches everything she does, a realization that played no small part in my decision. The New England Lab, like us, is an interdisciplinary research group that blends computer science, social science, and machine learning, yet from different enough perspectives to make this an almost perfect marriage. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that helping to found and lead a new research group amid the bursting tech scene in New York City, with the resources of Microsoft behind us, is \u2014 as Duncan says \u2014 a once-in-a-career opportunity. \n The press coverage Thursday was gratifying, including nice pieces in PCMag (source of the sweet logo above), NYTimes.com , AllThingsD , and dozens more . Here is the official press release . For science perspectives, see John Langford\u2019s , Lance Fortnow\u2019s , Dan Goldstein\u2019s , and Jennifer Chayes\u2019s blog posts. One of the coolest moments came when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg tweeted about us . \n Note that, despite the attrition , Yahoo! Labs lives on, probably more applied but not solely so. Ron Brachman , the new head of Yahoo! Labs, is terrific and may be able to do something special there. The Barcelona group remains largely intact and just got 7 (!) papers into SIGIR. Other groups remain intact as well. \n The reception within Microsoft research and product orgs has been swift and very warm. The breadth and scope of the place can be daunting at first but invigorating. The ability to impact products that touch hundreds of millions of people\u2019s lives is, as always, a rewarding draw of corporate research. Yet one of the deciding factors for many of us in joining Microsoft is the freedom to interact with universities in research, service, teaching, hosting visitors, hiring interns and postdocs, etc. In addition, we\u2019d like to play our part in the New York City tech scene, including the startup, venture-capitalist, and hack/make communities, plus the new Cornell-Technion campus, contributing to Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s vision of New York City as a tech hub. \n An interesting side note that bodes well for my two daughters ages 7 and 4 is that my primary decision boiled down to working for one of two brilliant and accomplished women: Jennifer Chayes at Microsoft, or Corinna Cortes at Google, who is absolutely terrific. Google is a incredible place, a model of efficiency, innovation, and ambition, with an impressive roster of people, and the company is in a very strong position. But this opportunity at Microsoft simply proved to be too good to pass up. I can\u2019t believe how perfectly everything fell into place.

Writing it brought back many wonderful memories and a tinge of sadness at the end of a truly amazing work environment for me, but I found the exercise rewarding.

My last day is tomorrow, \nThursday April 25 26. You can reach me in plenty of ways and I hope you do: \n [my email address] \n+1-732-XXX-XXXX \nY!IM pennockd | facebook pennockd | twitter pennockd | linkedin \nhttp://dpennock.com | http://blog.oddhead.com \n I\u2019ve grown to love this company (purple blood, yada yada) and one of the \ndeep ironies is that I have a feeling Scott Thompson may actually know \nwhat he is doing and that maybe just maybe Yahoo!\u2019s return to revenue \ngrowth and good public perception will finally come (note I didn\u2019t say \nreturn to profitability \u2014 a steady $1 billion in cashmoney profit in \nour pocket every year is very far from shabby). I plan to hold on to \nsome of my stock. \n In the early 2000s Google was an amazing Bem+Wom story yet almost no one \n(me included) had a clue how they would make money. In 2002, Gary Flake \nintroduced me to Overture, a company already making hundreds of millions \non search, and suddenly it was clear. I joined Gary in what became \nOverture Research and later, under Usama Fayyad\u2019s protective wing, the \ninception of \u201cYahoo! Research Labs\u201d. When Gary left, we hired Prabhakar \nand Ron. The rest is history. Andrei, Andrew, Raghu, Ravi, Ricardo, \nPreston, Duncan. An absolutely amazing place that was my pleasure to \nwatch grow and mature. I still remember the excitement of our first \noffsite at Half Moon Bay to map out the future of the place.* I remember \na fateful week when Preston, Duncan, and David Reiley simultaneously \ngave up their tenure to stay at Yahoo!. \n From the beginning Prabhakar saw the importance of including social \nscience research in the mix for online media. In my little corner, where \nwe mixed computer science and economics (\u201calgorithmic economics\u201d we \ncalled it), I believe we had enormous effect both internally and \nexternally. In 2007, Jeff MacKie-Mason, one of our Big Thinker lecturers \nand now Dean of the School of Information at the University of Michigan, \nwrote (ok, informally to me in email) that our group was \u201cthe most \nexciting and successful group I\u2019ve seen crossing the CS/Econ boundary\u201d. \nIf imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I believe we had a \nsignificant positive impact on the growth in hiring in the social \nsciences and in algorithmic economics at both Google and Microsoft. In \nour group alone, we published more than 70 papers including at least two \naward winners (Arpita just this year). We literally wrote the book \n(chapters) on sponsored search and prediction markets. We co-founded the \nAd Auctions Workshop and NYCE Day. People who left often did \nfantastically well, including Yiling Chen to Harvard, Mohammad Mahdian \nto Google, and Dan Reeves to found his own successful startup Beeminder. \nWe filed dozens of patents (take that fb!). Former intern Nicolas \nLambert who is now a Stanford professor once told me he hoped to one day \nsay \u201cit all started at Yahoo!\u201d. I just left a Ph.D. student\u2019s defense \nwhose three (!) weeks at Yahoo! were good for two chapters in his \nthesis. We\u2019ve had academic visitors leave after a week here and follow \nup that they wanted to apply for a job \u2014 the environment was that great. \n Inside Yahoo!, we worked on sponsored search (\u201csquashing\u201d and so much \nmore by the incomparable Sebastien Lahaie, who we recently discovered is \nthe central hub of research in New York), display ads, and UGC among \nmany topics. My passion has been in prediction (markets), and some of my \nbest memories have been trying to play product manager for a day (or a \ncouple months) for Predictalot and The Signal. Often it felt more like \noperating a startup but with incredible advantages in resources, people, \nand of course access to that monster traffic firehose. This was Yahoo! \nat it\u2019s best \u2014 marshaling talent from all over the globe in many \ndivisions and specialties to produce a product that no one had ever seen \nbefore, and that no one including us even knew would work. One of the \nsaddest parts of departing now is leaving The Signal behind, an \nincredible effort and in many ways our biggest and best, led by David \n\u201cforce-of-nature\u201d Rothschild and so many people behind it. Sadly, some \nwere let go and others are leaving on the own accord, and we\u2019ll never \nknow what could have been in a counterfactual universe. Yet I believe \nThe Signal will live on in the good hands of those who remain, including \nChris Wilson, Alex, Ingemar, and the absolutely phenomenal Bangalore team. \n By far the best part of working at Yahoo! was the people. It\u2019s been my \npleasure to work with so many fantastic colleagues in Labs and \nthroughout the company. In the recent turmoil many in Labs have been, as \nPreston said, \u201cevaluated by the market\u201d, and came out looking pretty \ndarn good, with calls, interviews, and offers from the best companies \n(Facebook, Google, Microsoft) and universities. Early on we set a goal \nto always hire above the mean, and I truly believe we did that. (Having \nbeen here from the beginning, you can see where that leaves me in this \nincredible crowd.) It\u2019s a cliche but a true one: I am only as good as \nthe people working with me, and I\u2019ve truly been blessed with amazing \ncolleagues, bosses, employees, postdocs, and interns. To Sebastien, \nArpita, Giro, and David Rothschild, plus Mridul, Navneet, Sudar, Arun, \nShrikant, Kim, Chris, Janet, Ron, Michael and dozens more and everyone \nwho has come before, from Preston & Prabhakar on down, I can\u2019t thank you \nenough and I owe you almost everything. \n Goodbye for now, \nDave \n * For history buffs, these were the people at the initial Yahoo! \nResearch offsite: Prabhakar Raghavan, Dennis DeCoste, David Pennock, \nOmid Madani, Shyam Kapur, Andrew Tomkins, Winton Davies, Ravi Kumar, \nBernard Mangold, Ron Brachman, Marc Davis, Michael Mahoney, Kevin Lang, \nSeung-Taek Park, and Dan Fain. \n ** I also remember the first few days of Yahoo!

(The latter is an Amazon subsidiary.)\u00a0The best way to understand Kiva Systems is to watch their robots in action: an amazing sight to see. Here is a clip from IEEE Spectrum : \n \n In 2003, I remember sitting in the back seat of a car with Pete, him excitedly demo-ing the concept to me via an animated simulation on his laptop, little dots representing robots weaving in and out of each on the screen. (Pete\u2019s laptop was a mac. In grad school, Pete was every bit the Apple fan\u00a0 I was \u00a0and more. He and I programmed HyperCard and Newton together. Pete advocated for simplicity in design before it was cool. When I briefly switched to Windows, he never wavered.) \n By 2006, the robots were real. Pete took me and our shared academic parent, Mike Wellman (who I believe also played an early role in the company), on a tour. Dots on a laptop had become squat orange robots receiving orders, fetching products, avoiding each other, seeking power, and otherwise navigating around a complex environment with computational minds of their own. The designs were inspired: for example, to lift a box, the robot spun underneath it to extend a corkscrew so that the product wouldn\u2019t get jarred. They even added noise in the robots\u2019 paths, so their wheels wouldn\u2019t wear grooves in the floor (call it a floorsaver algorithm). \n By coincidence, a few weeks ago, I was speaking to someone from Amazon who works on optimizing the way people (ha!) retrieve, store, and pack items in their distribution centers and I mentioned Pete\u2019s company. He said \u201cuntil that happens\u201d he would focus on optimizing their current systems. Little did we (or at least I) know how quickly \u201cuntil\u201d would come. \n Kiva Systems isn\u2019t just an incredibly cool company run by amazing people. It\u2019s a harbinger of things to come as the world moves inexorably toward an Automated Economy . \n By the way, if you\u2019re worried that robots will take jobs away from people , don\u2019t. The world is a better place with mechanical devices doing mechanical tasks, leaving people to do more interesting and creative things, for example turning crazy ideas into companies. Remember that the purpose of jobs is to produce valuable things and improve the world. Despite political rhetoric, jobs are not an end to themselves. Otherwise, we should all be happy digging ditches and filling them back up, or pumping gas for people who would rather do it themselves . Think about where society should go in fifty or a hundred years when automation can handle more and more tasks.

The buyer takes ownership of the bet slip and he or she can keep it or resell it again to another Slipjockey user, etc. The final owner of any bet slip is paid in full directly from the sports book that originally issued the ticket. \n \n Real-time trading on Slipjockey is similar to the action on betting exchanges like Betfair. The key difference is that all wagers must originate from a licensed Nevada race and sports book where gambling is legal. \n The Slipjockey business concept grew from the notion that handicappers should have an option other that win, lose, or push. Slipjockey provides that fourth option by enabling handicappers to terminate their outcome risk, locking in a gain or avoiding a total loss prior to the end of the event. With the growth in live betting (aka \u201cin-running betting\u201d) around the world, and in Las Vegas courtesy of Cantor Fitzgerald , it\u2019s clearly an option that people want. \n Initially, Slipjockey is focused on launching with coverage of US football, tennis, and golf before expanding into other sports. \n I\u2019ve spoken mainly with Ryan Eads and his brother Rory, two of the co-founders. They are smart, well spoken, and tireless entrepreneurs. I have every expectation that, to the extent this idea has wings \u2014 and I believe it does \u2014 they will make it fly. \n The first question you\u2019re likely to ask is: is this legal? Indeed, that\u2019s the first question I asked Ryan. As a pre-condition to launching, he secured a legal opinion from a former Nevada Gaming Control Board attorney that says, in effect, that because bets originate in Las Vegas and are ultimately paid out in Las Vegas, the Slipjockey exchange is legal. The attorney\u2019s opinion is just that: an opinion, and not a guarantee. But it is convincing and credible. Certainly Slipjockey users are safe. \n Currently, Slipjockey is inviting users to participate in a soft launch for trading National Football League games.

I\u2019ve been a consistent Mac in the Mac-vs-PC battle since 1984 (though I admit to a brief affair in 1998: it didn\u2019t mean anything, Steve, I swear!). Jobs himself ignited an us-versus-them fire, which smolders on today in Apple\u2019s John Hodgman -as-PC ads, back in 1985 with one of his best quotes : \n Playboy: Are you saying that the people who made PCjr don\u2019t have \u2026 pride in [their] product? \n [Jobs:] \u201cIf they did, they wouldn\u2019t have made the PCjr.\u201d [Playboy, Feb. 1, 1985]\n \n Around that time, my friends and I had a running joke: \u201cI got a PCjr,\u201d one of us would say; \u201cyou\u2019re going straight to hell, kid,\u201d the other would shoot back. \n  \n Buried treasure: Old Apple II and Power Macintosh computers, waiting to be dusted off\u2026 someday \n My wife and kids (ages 7 and 4) are more recent converts, owning a Duo, an iPhone, an iPad, and two iPod Touches among them. \n I\u2019ve owned Apple stock since about 1997, my single best investment, increasing 4,460 percent. (Priceline is my second best, gaining 3,990%.) \n Like Lance , I\u2019ll never forget where I was when I learned that Steve Jobs had died. Steven Colbert told me. Live. After a hilarious taping of the Colbert Report and four performances by the artist formerly known as Mos Def (apparently a perfectionist: who knew?), Colbert ended by balancing his iPhone on his desk, letting it fall over, then telling us, \u201cSteve Jobs died. Sorry to be the one to tell you.\u201d To say the mood of the audience changed instantly would be an understatement. Smiling faces turned down. Cries of anguish and \u201coh no!\u201d rang out from nearly everyone in the audience, a mark of how Jobs\u2019s influence and name recognition has grown from tech hero to global cultural icon . (Colbert gave Jobs a proper tribute the next day.) \n There\u2019s a thread in our office about the extent to which perceived success or failure at the CEO level is a fooled-by-randomness trick of the mind. But there are some examples where even the strongest skeptic must admit that an organization\u2019s success is almost surely owed to the exceptional greatness of a single individual. Warren Buffet and Coach K come to (my) mind. But Steve Jobs must be the prime example. As if ushering in the era of personal computing and computer-animated movies was not enough, Jobs continued to outdo himself year after year, with iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and, barely a year ago, iPad. Sadly, or maybe purposefully, Jobs seemed to hit his stride just as he died. As a long-time disciple of Jobs, I\u2019m amazed at the amount of focus in his obituaries spent on gadgets he created in the last ten years. \n Jobs famously advised not to spend too much time celebrating success. \n I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what\u2019s next. \n\u2014NBC Nightly News, 2006 \n Those were not empty words for Jobs: it\u2019s how he lived his own life and how he squeezed so much out of the 56 short years he was given. The early storyline of Apple pegged Steve Wozniak as the brains and Jobs as the lucky business-minded sidekick. It turns out that Jobs was way more exceptional than the 1990s nerderati\u00a0\u2014 who like me relate more to Woz\u00a0\u2014 gave him credit for. Jobs had the brains, the vision, and the charisma in a combination so rare I\u2019m not the only one who can\u2019t think of another human alive who compares. To get a taste, read or watch Jobs\u2019s Stanford commencement speech : it\u2019s truly brilliant, inspiring, and one of the best ways you can spend the next few minutes of your time. \n To the ultimate hacker painter , the first last analog , the nerdiest salesman, the studliest genius, the most productive perfectionist, the most detail-oriented visionary, and a personal hero : \n 20 Print \"Goodbye\""], "link": "http://blog.oddhead.com/2011/10/13/goodbye-steve-jobs/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://online.wsj.com/": 1, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1, "http://techcrunch.com/": 2, "http://www.npr.org/": 3, "http://news.yahoo.com/blog": 1, "http://news.stanford.edu/": 1, "http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/": 1, "http://www.paulgraham.com/": 1, "http://blogs.wsj.com/": 1, "http://www.youtube.com/": 1, "http://ezstreetshow.com/": 1, "http://www.thedailybeast.com/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 1, "http://gawker.com/": 1, "http://blog.oddhead.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Oddhead Blog"}, {"content": ["My geek CEO was fired. If you\u2019re wondering whether she deserved it, or Yahoo! is better off for it, or Roy Bostock is a doofus or dorfus , I don\u2019t really know.* But I do have a personal story about Carol Bartz that\u2019s indicative of the kind of CEO she was and the kind of person she is, perfect for Ada Lovelace day , a day to blog about women in science and technology who inspire you. \n In May 2010, my wife Lauren was diagnosed with breast cancer. On Sunday, May 9, 2010\u2014Mother\u2019s Day no less\u2014I received a phone call. \u201cHello?,\u201d I said. \u201cHi, this is Carol Bartz,\u201d she said. \u201cWow!,\u201d I couldn\u2019t help saying. I had never spoken to her before. She proceeded to say how sorry she was for me and Lauren, to reassure us, to ask me questions, and to answer mine. \n More than a year, multiple surgeries, and six chemo sessions later, I\u2019m happy to say that Lauren is past the worst part of the treatment and, to the best of anyone\u2019s knowledge, cancer free. At the time, we were frightened, bewildered, and angry. To me, the most overwhelming feeling was disbelief. Was this really happening to us? It was surreal. Lauren\u2019s strength and sheer will to keep our home life as normal as possible, and her ability to turn the ordeal into a positive is amazing and helped me cope. That my mom and Lauren\u2019s mom went through the same thing also helped. The more we looked into it the more we realized breast cancer was everywhere\u2014shockingly common even at Lauren\u2019s age. (Especially in New Jersey, one of only five states in the top tier for both incidence of and mortality from breast cancer.) The calls to increase the age of first mammogram border on criminal. One silver lining for Lauren has been meeting the amazing support community of breast cancer sufferers, survivors, and their friends. They have inspired her to give back in many ways . My mom, a radiologist and ACR fellow , was herself inspired to specialize in mammography and pursue breast cancer research . \n It turns out, Carol Bartz is a survivor herself and, in addition to being one of the fifty most powerful women in business, is just another member of the breast cancer support community who cares deeply. Carol had over twelve thousand employees. To take the time to call one of them on a holiday weekend to address personal problems and pain shows the kind of leader she is. (And shows the kind of bosses Preston and Prabhakar are, who thought enough to bring it to her attention.) It\u2019s a \u201cYahoo! moment\u201d and a Carol moment that I remember vividly and continues to stick out in my mind. I suspect most stereotypes of corporate and public leaders as conniving powermad ladder climbers are just that: stereotypes. But still, I\u2019m convinced that not all\u2014probably few\u2014CEOs would do what Carol Bartz did. Goodbye, good luck, and, most of all: Thanks, Carol. \n \n * I will say that I respect Carol\u2019s willingness give her blunt assessment of the board, possibly risking $10 million to do so, and to come right out and say \u201cI was fired\u201d rather than hide behind \u201cmore time with family\u201d cliches. I\u2019m not surprised that the board gave their full confidence to her in public just two months before firing her\u2014of course a board always has to say that they have confidence in their current CEO. I am surprised and dismayed that, at least judging by her reaction, it seems the board was also giving their confidence to her in private. That\u2019s HR 101: No one who\u2019s fired should be surprised."], "link": "http://blog.oddhead.com/2011/10/07/thanks-carol-bartz/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.savelady.com/": 1, "http://www.komencsnj.org/": 1, "http://www.mcafee.cc/": 1, "http://money.cnn.com/": 1, "http://postcards.cnn.com/": 2, "http://scholar.google.com/": 1, "http://finance.cnn.com/": 1, "http://findingada.com/": 1, "http://blogs.wsj.com/": 1, "http://www.acr.org/": 1, "http://research.yahoo.com/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://blog.oddhead.com/": 1, "http://www.urbandictionary.com/": 1, "http://www.cdc.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Oddhead Blog"}, {"content": ["The Second Conference on Auctions, Market Mechanisms and Their Applications (AMMA) is next Monday and Tuesday August 22-23, 2011, at CUNY in midtown manhattan.
