A debate, bi its nature, shouldn't be a subject easy to visualize, but day after the day, media gets to publish great graphics, in a record time, about what is said on these spaces. These are some examples of graphics on this topic, new and old. \n \n \n \n The New York Times: the replay \n \nNo surprises. NYT uses to do spectacular (and effective graphics) with almost any topic. Debates are not an exception. \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nThis interactive way to replay the vice-presidential debate may not be a graphic. I don't mind the name: graphic, design, layout... It's a different way to present the information, easy to navigate and with fact-checking embedded. \n \n \n \n Boston Globe: the intensity \n \nDaigo Fujiwara and Alvin Chang created this graphic visualizing the intensity of the Biden and Ryan answers at the VP debate. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClick in the image and, in less than 30 seconds, tell me the three most controversial topics of the debate: taxes, defense and medicare jump to your eyes. And you easily see how abortion was not something to discuss. And you can also have more detailed information with just a mouse-over. That's what graphics can do: give you a good summary at a glance and allow you to get deeper without problems. \n \n \n \n Publico: everything else \n \nFour years ago, Rajoy and Zapatero had a TV debate, after many years without this kind of face-offs in Spain. So Publico, a very political newspaper where I was working with other very talented infographic journalist, wanted to cover it with a breaking news double spread explaining all the details around the candidates and their performing. The political analysis will have pages of text. This was something else. \n \nThis was the result. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe body language, the bets moments, the mentions, the timeline... we focused on the most visual details of the confrontation. \n \n \n \n NPR: the details \n \nThis is not a debate graphic. Not even a graphic, maybe, but as I told before, I dont mind the names. \n \nBut they created the debate from speeches and presented it in a very different way, as an homage to the famous pop-up videos. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThey focus on some details, fact checking and curiosities. What is behind the declarations. \n \n \n \n \n \n UPDATE \n \n \n \n Periscopic: the issues \n \n Periscopic has also its own way to visualize the presidential debate words through Politilines.com ., 'Connecting the issues to the candidates' is the motto of this initiative. And so it is. \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nA direct way to know what the candidates are saying about certain topics... and who's talking about the topic chosen (and what are they saying)."], "link": "http://infographicsnews.blogspot.com/feeds/2413439438741628199/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.bostonglobe.com/": 1, "http://politilines.periscopic.com/": 2, "http://www.blogger.com/": 2, "http://www.npr.org/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://chiquiesteban.com/": 1, "http://www.periscopic.com/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Infographics news"}, {"content": ["You've read so many times here news about Alberto Cairo.

Actually, what they publish is a version of the Kick Ass game by Rootof Creations, as indicated in the source. Usually, these ideas look absolutely mad when proposed in other newsrooms. Then, The New York Times or any other respected newspapers uses it and all those who banned the idea in their media clap like crazy. Maybe that's why NYT is so innovative. They don't mind how important they are, they are open to new ideas and don't think a game or an animated GIF (as published today on its frontpage) is not as serious as they should be. \n \n  \nBut is not the first time The New York Times uses a game to explain something. And, in my opinion, not, by far, the best. In fact, this is just some amusement, meanwhile other times NYT has used those games as a really effective way to explain some concepts. \n \nMy favorite is the Rock-Paper-Scissors game to understand how robots think. Smart and completely amazing. \n  \n It's not a game just for the sake of having a game in the page (as the one on the top of the article). It's actually an explanation in disguise. And a really good one. \n The same they did when they wanted you to know why is dangerous to text and drive. Other incredible piece called Gauging your Distraction . \n  \n Better than a text and giving you the reasons, they give the experience. The classical Show Don't Tell! as its best. \nThis particular piece made me think much about it, and from them I always try to look for the possibility of using games to explain information. Sometimes just slightly , sometimes on a more evident way . \n \nGames are not just about making things funny. Means better understanding of the information. Reader engagement.

Use of audio \n Trial excerpt: Getting to not Guilty | The Boston Globe \n \n \n  \n \nThe idea is simple, actually: they wanted to explain how things happen on the Court, so what they give is the complete audio of a session, the transcript and a colored bar marks what's playing the audio. This particular case explains the story of the judgement of a person who confessed being guilty of driving drunk and cause an accident in the moment it happened but was declared not guilty after all. \n \n Why I like it? \nIt really explains the information in the best possible way. No fireworks. I can't figure myself reading a long article about this topic, and I guess won't be enough just hearing the audio. But they way The Boston Globe mixed both created a very effective piece: the voices, the doubts, how they talked, wth the transcript to follow the action on an easier way... Smart, effective, objective journalism. \n \n \n 2. Multimedia Integration \n At the Metropolitan Museum, a new wing, a new vista | The New York Times \n \n \n  \n \nThe Metropolitan Museum was opening a new islamic wing and The New York Times created this virtual visit to all lounges, with navigable panoramas, image details, audio explanations and other details. \n \n Why I like it? \n \nNone of the separated elements is very original. I've seen better navigable panoramas, better image details, better audio explanations, better wing maps... but all the stuff is brought together on a really great way. Multimedia pieces are not just juxtaposed, but integrated. So here 1+1+1+1 is more than 4. And with really good details, like the tiny map on the left, advancing with the scroll and changing depending on the lounge you're watching each moment. \n \n 3. Use of social networks \n Cast Your Vote, 2011 Oscar | The New York Times \n \n \n  \n \nThe Oscar 2011 special by The New York Times invites you, as many others, to fill your own ballot. But there's an extra point: the possibility to share it on Facebook with your friends and play against them. \n \n Why I like it? \n \nAll media know they have to do things with social networks, but no one knows exactly what to do. This is what to do. This special piece by the Grey Lady is a perfect demonstration of how social pieces can be without complex developments. A really social product. \n \n 4. Different use of video \n Pop up politics | National Public Radio \n \n \n  \n \nDo you remember VH1 Pop Up Videos ? NPR has adapted that idea to politics: videos showing funny things about what's happening on them, but here NPR is using speeches of the republican candidates instead of music videos. \n \n \n Why I like it? \n \nOk, the idea is not original, but changing the context to politics add a very interesting layer (and changes the sometimes hieratic face of elections info). Maybe this particular example by NPR has too many 'funny' things rather then 'important', but is a very good way to analyze speeches, and on videos, so important for advertising revenues nowadays. \n \n 5. Vertical narratives \n How Osama Bin Laden was located and killed | The New York Times \n \n \n \n  \n \nA colection of graphics and multimedia pieces about the capture of Osama Bin Laden by, yes, again, The New York Times. This vertical system completing the information step by step is not exclusive of the Times, but a format each time more popular in the United States media. \n \n Why I like it? \n \nIf the example of the Metropolitan was great because of the integration over the juxtaposition, here is the opposite: the juxtaposition works over the integration. The format creates a linear narrative, with differentiated pieces, indexed with the tiny fixed menu at the left. The story is told by steps, like the successful Mariano Rivera video infographic. \n \n Complete list of awards, SND Digital 2012"], "link": "http://infographicsnews.blogspot.com/feeds/2892552702702528314/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.bostonglobe.com/": 2, "http://www.snd.org/": 1, "http://oscars.nytimes.com/": 2, "http://www.npr.org/": 2, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://infografistas.com.es/": 1, "http://www.vh1.com/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 4, "http://www.facebook.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Infographics news"}, {"content": ["Tweet Share \n \nThis is the key week to end sticking portfolios together, gathering URLs and decide the best graphics of this year on each department.

From Spain, we are really jealous of how the government offers data in different lenguages and formats to be used and consulted by citizens and media. \n \nOne good example is the 2010 census: all kind of data about the population of such big and heterogeneous country is a very big opportunity to show what can we do with all that data and make it easy to access for citizens. Global and local, giving a general idea of the country, but also allowing people to check information of their own neighborhoods. \n \nThese are some examples of work with this information: \n (If you know other interesting examples, just tell me in the comments of this post) \n \n \n The New York Times \n Mapping America: Every city, every block \n \n  \nI've talked about it separately .

As a result of our speed advantage we can work with much larger databases.
