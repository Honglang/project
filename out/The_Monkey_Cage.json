Bennett Honors Professor in political science at the University of Connecticut. You can find his previous posts here and follow him on Twitter at @djpressman . \n\n\t ***** \n\n\t Former Gov. Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama have tried to out-do each other in their love for Israel, mentioning it more than 30 times in the third presidential debate. An observer would surely be left with the impression that the great determinant of the tightness of that alliance, at least from the U.S. side, was which party was most committed to Israel. \n\n\t Yet scholars have long looked for more fundamental explanations of the American-Israeli alliance. In 1996, Michael Barnett concisely argued that shared values best explains this special relationship. It is a case of two liberal democracies joining hands. (I\u2019ll leave aside three other possibilities: military-strategic links, domestic lobbying , and alliance restraint .) An article ( gated ) last year by Michael Koplow (@mkoplow) emphasized the strong support in U.S. public opinion polls for robust U.S.-Israeli relations. Koplow also highlighted an ideological base to this support: \u201cthe general public identifies with Israel as a Western-style democracy.\u201d \n\n\t It led me to wonder: what if Israel and the United States are moving further apart on values? Israel has long been expanding its settlements, the occupation continues, and illiberal legislation has grown, all seemingly undercutting an emphasis on shared U.S.-Israeli values. \n\n\t In the original essay in 1996, Barnett himself worried about the settlement project:\u00a0 \u201cNo doubt Israel\u2019s presence and policies in the territories were eroding the foundations of the special relationship.\u201d Since Barnett wrote that line, the Israeli occupation and building of settlements in the West Bank has continued apace. In 1996, Israel had 303,100 settlers in the West Bank including East Jerusalem. Today there are over half a million settlers . Millions of Palestinians live under occupation as non-citizens with limited rights. \n\n\t In addition, questions are being asked about illiberal Israeli legislation and the treatment of Israel\u2019s largest minority, its Palestinian citizens. A new survey of Israeli Jews demonstrated many with illiberal tendencies. Moreover, during much of Netanyahu\u2019s administration, analysts have debated the importance of legislation proposed or passed to block Palestinian commemoration of the Nakba , remove Arabic as an official language, or punish Israelis who support boycotting goods from Israeli settlements. Civil society has come under attack. Israel\u2019s Council for Higher Education pressed for reform or closure of the department of political science at Ben-Gurion University. Academic debates about whether Israel is a democracy or ethnocracy continue. \n\n\t Even the new election campaign has provided some food for thought as Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party merged with Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s Yisrael Beiteinu party. While the merger will surely affect the electoral outcome in early 2013, Peter Beinart highlighted a different result: the end of the Likud\u2019s commitment to liberalism. (The Likud itself was originally created in part from Israel\u2019s Liberal Party.) Beinart cited Aluf Benn of Ha\u2019aretz who wrote that Likud will now become \u201ca radical right-wing party, aggressive and xenophobic.\u201d (See also this smart take on the exclusion of \u201cthe dreaded \u2018Arab Parties.\u2019\u201d) \n\n\t Now perhaps this fear for Israeli liberalism and democracy is overblown. That I can string together a survey and some anecdotal evidence could be of limited value. But what if Israeli liberal values are deeply contested? \n\n\t One could argue that maybe Barnett and Koplow were just wrong about the centrality of an identity explanation, because during this same period of settlement expansion, the U.S.-Israeli military relationship has stayed quite strong. Israel has continued to receive tens of billions of dollars in U.S. military assistance and access to advanced weapons technology. So even as Israel has pursued a policy in the West Bank that seems like a rejection of the very values that supposedly underlie the alliance, the alliance has stayed strong. \n\n\t Alternatively, maybe we should turn back to other explanations such as military-strategic links, domestic lobbying, or alliance restraint. \n\n\t Or, maybe we have not reached the decisive moment for evaluating the shared identity explanation. As much as people have talked about the impending conflict for Israeli Jewish society between its Jewish identity and its democratic status, the Israeli decision not to annex the West Bank has left a certain amount of ambiguity. The idea of a two-state solution, which would allow Israel to choose democracy and Jewish identity, is not dead; it is hurting badly, but a two-state solution is not impossible. (Or maybe even if it is impossible on the ground, the broader perception remains that it is still possible if less likely than 10 years ago.) \n\n\t In short, maybe we are approaching but have not yet reached the moment when the shared values mantra supported by Barnett and Koplow will be truly tested. And even then, it could be that a different factor, say strategic links or a shared commitment to fight terrorism, will cement the ties were shared values to fall by the wayside. In the meantime, we can count on Obama and Romney to keep the issue in the spotlight for a few more days."], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/themonkeycagefeed/~3/Z8s96jUghAY/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.fmep.org/": 2, "https://twitter.com/": 1, "http://www.cornell.edu/": 1, "http://www.uconn.edu/": 1, "http://www.npr.org/": 1, "http://www.haaretz.com/": 3, "http://www.tandfonline.com/": 1, "http://themonkeycage.org/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://souciant.com/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 2, "http://latitude.nytimes.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Monkey Cage"}, {"content": ["A group called EGAP (Experiments in Governance and Politics) is considering a proposal to establish a \u201cPilot Registry for Research Designs\u201d where scholars could register new research projects, specifying in advance the topic, data to be collected, hypotheses to be tested, data analysis to be conducted, and conditions under which the hypotheses would be accepted or refuted. Once the research was conducted and written up, journal editors and referees would have access to the corresponding prospectus in order to verify that the results reported in the paper were not instances of \u201cpublication bias\u201d or mindless \u201cfishing\u201d for statistically significant results. Upon publication, or after some pre-specified period of time, the corresponding research prospectus would be in the public domain. \n\n\t The focus of the pilot proposal is on \u201cProspective Research\u201d designs, whether experimental or observational,\u00a0\u201dfor which outcomes \u00a0 have not yet been realized.\u201d That is mostly not what I do. Nevertheless, a friend\u2014perhaps inspired by the proposers\u2019\u00a0interest in expanding the system to include \u201cretrospective studies,\u201d and\u00a0in using\u00a0experience with\u00a0the proposed pilot registry to decide \u201c whether to make registration mandatory for some kinds of research\u201d\u2014asks, as a \u201cthought experiment,\u201d how such a system would affect my work, suggesting as an example my 1996 article on \u201cUninformed Votes.\u201d My response is\u00a0below the fold. \n I\u2019ve done some papers\u2014including that one\u2014that are sufficiently simple-minded that they would not be much affected by a process of the sort you describe. On the other hand, it is also an example of an instance in which effective enforcement would seem to be impossible. I have the NES cumulative file on my computer; what\u2019s to stop me from ransacking it night and day for random correlations, then submitting the best 5% (suitably dressed up as \u201chypotheses to be tested\u201d) to the registry? I suppose I could be made to wait for new data, but in this case that moratorium would still be in effect (since I used six presidential elections\u2014and NES might not last long enough to provide six more). \n More often, my projects start with questions rather than \u201chypotheses\u201d and end with findings of varying credibility rather than \u201caccept or refute\u201d decisions. I think of that as a kind of science\u2014indeed, as the most fruitful kind of science we can do given where we are in our understanding of politics. And I think of the credibility of the findings as depending much more on the quality of the data and analysis than on their theoretical provenance or predictability (or, for that matter, their \u201cstatistical significance\u201d). I recognize that many other scholars are more rigid in their views (and many others less so), which is fine with me, as long as we don\u2019t have to waste a lot of potentially valuable time debating, or legislating, epistemology. (I assume there would be some journals that would not opt into the \u201cregistry\u201d system, and I would stick with those rather than \u201cconstrain my implementation of the projects\u201d I work on.) \n But you want examples. Since I hosted a workshop on Unequal Democracy a few weeks ago (I am just starting to work on a revised edition), I\u2019ve thought recently about those analyses and can provide a brief, chapter-by-chapter run-down: \n \u00a01. (Introduction) All pre-existing data in public domain and previously analyzed in similar ways by other scholars. Not sure whether or how this would be covered, since it is \u201cmerely\u201d descriptive analysis. \n 2. The Partisan Political Economy . All pre-existing data in public domain. I set out to look for partisan patterns of income growth, but without any very strong preconceptions about what I would find. Having found them, I tried to make them go away, using a variety of data I didn\u2019t know existed when I started. In the course of attempting to understand where these partisan differences came from, I also discovered some unexpected secondary patterns in the data that seem to me to shed light on that question (honeymoon years vs. non-honeymoon years; first terms following partisan turnover vs. others). \n 3. Class Politics and Partisan Change . All pre-existing data in public domain. This was an adaptation of previously published work, and shaped in a variety of ways by discussion and criticism of that work (e.g., differing implications of alternative measures of \u201cclass\u201d; more elaborate analysis of a variety of potential \u201cwedge\u201d issues in 2004 NES data). \n 4. Partisan Biases in Economic Accountability . All pre-existing data in public domain. I had worked on \u201cmyopia\u201d in economic voting in a separate project with Chris Achen, but did not think to connect it with partisan patterns of income growth until the two papers had sat near each other on my desk for a couple years. I had thought to look at economic voting by income class using NES data, then thought to examine class-specific growth, then thought to examine the effect of high-income growth on other income groups. Your editor and referees would have to decide whether the caveats in the text (\u201crather remarkably suggest,\u201d \u201cnot impossible that the apparent electoral significance of high-income growth is merely a statistical fluke\u201d) and robustness checks in the notes (dropping elections, considering various sub-samples of the data, comparing growth for other groups) were sufficient to make this pattern eligible for reporting. \n 5. Do Americans Care About Inequality? Mix of old and new data. Entirely descriptive except (perhaps) for interactions between information and ideology (which John Zaller would take as evidence of \u201cpolarization,\u201d except that the concept had not previously been applied to \u201cobjective\u201d facts). \n \u00a06. Homer Gets a Tax Cut . Mix of old and new data. The NES module I helped design included some items reflecting my interests and expectations and others suggested by collaborators with their own agendas. The concept of \u201cunenlightened self-interest,\u201d which is the most novel theoretical underpinning of the analyses, was induced from the data rather than derived from anywhere. The analyses of partisanship and information, egalitarian values, and trade-off preferences among taxes, spending, and deficits were all added in response to suggestions from readers of earlier versions. \n 7. The Strange Appeal of Estate Tax Repeal . Ditto 6, with some historical analysis added subsequent to data collection that made the implications of the chapter in the context of the book quite different than I had in mind at the start. \n 8. The Eroding Minimum Wage . All publicly available data (aside from some income breakdowns of public polls provided by Marty Gilens). Largely descriptive. Partisan differences (Table 8.2) anticipated; partisan interactions (Table 8.3) unanticipated (and not \u201cstatistically significant\u201d); effects of constituency opinion and partisanship on roll call vote anticipated, but only after it occurred to me that I had overlapping data (from Chapter 9). \n 9. Economic Inequality and Political Representation . All publicly available data. All of the analyses originally assumed a linear effect of income on political influence; the non-parametric specification with three income groups was suggested by readers of an early draft. The analysis of mechanisms (turnout, knowledge, contact) in Table 9.11 was an unanticipated elaboration; not sure where that came from. \n 10. (Conclusion) No data. Sections headed \u201cWho Governs?\u201d and \u201cPolitical Obstacles to Economic Equality\u201d could have been anticipated when I started the project; sections headed \u201cPartisan Politics and the \u2018Have-Nots\u2019\u201d and \u201cThe City of Utmost Necessity\u201d could not (at least by me). \n You should feel free to share any of this, if any of it seems helpful. \n All the best, \n Larry"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/themonkeycagefeed/~3/LiIv9M2dJUA/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://themonkeycage.org/": 1, "http://e-gap.org/": 2, "http://themonkeycage.org/blog": 1, "https://my.vanderbilt.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Monkey Cage"}, {"content": ["From my online NYT column : \n\n\t For months now people I know have been stopping me on the street to ask who I think will win the election. And for months I\u2019ve always said, either side could win it. . . . Different models use different economic and political variables to predict the vote, but these predictions pretty much average to 50-50. . . . \n\n\t Last week I was interviewed by a reporter from France, who asked me who I thought would win the election. I said, it\u2019s too close to call. He said, but Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight blog on NYTimes.com currently gives Obama a 72.9 percent chance. I think Nate is great, and I was thrilled to have the opportunity to contribute to his blog for a while. But I\u2019d still say the election is too close to call. . . . \n\n\t The online betting service Intrade gives Obama a 62 percent chance of winning, and I respect this number too, as it reflects the opinions of people who are willing to put money on the line. The difference between 63 percent and 75 percent may sound like a lot, but it corresponds to something like a difference of half a percentage point in Obama\u2019s forecast vote share. Put differently, a change in 0.5 percent in the forecast of Obama\u2019s vote share corresponds to a change in a bit more than 10 percent in his probability of winning. Either way, the uncertainty is larger than the best guess at the vote margin. \n\n\t Where is this uncertainty coming from? First, public opinion can shift quickly during the last week of campaigning, as news arrives and as voters make their final decisions. Second, the polls aren\u2019t perfect. Nonresponse rates continue to rise and, although pollsters are working on more and more sophisticated methods for correcting for this problem \u2014 an area of my research \u2014 we cannot always catch up. Even an average of polls can be wrong, but it\u2019s hard to know in advance of the election how wrong they will be, or in which direction. \n\n\t What I\u2019m saying is that I can simultaneously (a) accept that Obama has a 72 percent chance of winning and (b) say the election is too close to call. . . . \n\n\t More at the link , including a discussion of why it\u2019s not correct to say that \u201cRomney\u2019s a touchdown behind with five minutes to play.\u201d"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/themonkeycagefeed/~3/cDRK0SnytSc/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://andrewgelman.com/": 1, "http://campaignstops.nytimes.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "The Monkey Cage"}, {"content": ["Those are from U of Chicago political scientist Boris Shor.\u00a0 More here ."], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/themonkeycagefeed/~3/bnvngcxE4rI/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://research.bshor.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Monkey Cage"}, {"content": ["In my earlier post , I modeled the choices of decided voters and then looked to see what that model would predict about the remaining undecided voters.\u00a0 The apparent answer was that these voters will break pretty evenly for Obama and Romney. \n\n\t My co-author Lynn Vavreck suggested a different approach.\u00a0 In our data for The Gamble , we have interviews from a December 2011 YouGov survey with approximately 44,000 respondents.\u00a0 Then each week from January until Election Day, YouGov reinterviewed a different subset of 1,000 respondents from among these 44,000.\u00a0 In other words, we have a two-wave panel, where the date of the second wave varies. \n\n\t Lynn\u2019s suggested approach was: take the people who were undecided in December 2011 but decided in a later survey, model their choices, and then see what this predicts for the remaining undecided voters (as in my first post, these are the 195 undecided respondents in the 3 YouGov polls since the first debate).\u00a0 The assumption here is that the remaining undecideds will make up their minds the way the earlier undecideds have\u2014which is more plausible than assuming, as I was, that undecideds make up their minds like the decideds do.\u00a0 (Of course, it\u2019s still an assumption.) \n\n\t In this case, the answer is much the same: the remaining undecided voters are predicted to split fairly evenly\u2014about 55% for Obama and 45% for Romney.\u00a0 Given the uncertainty in these estimates, I don\u2019t think this implies a definitive Obama \u201cwin\u201d among these voters.\u00a0 Ultimately, these models do not suggest either candidate will get a significant advantage from late-breaking undecided voters.\u00a0 The same caveats noted in my earlier post apply here as well."], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/themonkeycagefeed/~3/fumATlpDw2k/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.lynnvavreck.com/": 1, "http://thegamble2012.com/": 1, "http://themonkeycage.org/blog": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Monkey Cage"}, {"content": ["Continuing our series of\u00a0 election reports , \u00a0the following post-election report on Ukraine\u2019s 2012 parliamentary election is provided by frequent Monkey Cage contributor University of Toronto political scientist Lucan Way . \n\n\t ****** \n\n\t Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections in Ukraine provide a revealing look into the developing characteristics of authoritarianism in Yanukovych\u2019s Ukraine.\u00a0 They suggest that while the regime has become much more authoritarian in recent years, important arenas of contestation remain.\u00a0 Thus far, Ukraine is still a competitive authoritarian rather than fully authoritarian regime. \n\n\t Since coming to power in 2010 in a hotly contested Presidential election , Yanukovych has concentrated control at a dizzying speed. By the end of his first year, he had reversed political reforms passed during the Orange revolution that had significantly weakened the Presidency.\u00a0 In problematic local elections in late October, his Party of Regions gained majorities in cities and provinces throughout east, central, and southern Ukraine. \u00a0\u00a0Most critically, Yanukovych has jailed two key leaders of the Orange Revolution , Yuri Lutsenko and Yulia Tymoshenko. \u00a0\u00a0Tymoshenko, who barely lost to Yanukovych in 2010, was sentenced in late 2011 to seven years in jail for \u201cabuse of office\u201d during her tenure as Prime Minister. \u00a0Similarly, Lutsenko, who led protests against the Kuchma regime in 2001 and 2004, has been jailed for four years on charges of embezzlement.\u00a0 Such blatantly political prosecutions have garnered widespread criticism of the Yanukovych regime by US and EU authorities. Not even former President Leonid Kuchma jailed opposition for extended periods of time. \n\n\t Given so much authoritarian backsliding over the last two years, we might have expected the most recent parliamentary elections to be especially dirty.\u00a0 Indeed, the elections demonstrated that the Party of Regions have created a highly uneven playing field .\u00a0\u00a0 The ruling party\u2019s overwhelming access to patronage resources and informal control over the Central Election Commission \u2013 among other advantages \u2013 has created highly uneven conditions for the opposition in Ukraine. \u00a0And, most notably, Lutsenko and Tymoshenko were deprived of the right to participate.\u00a0 Ukraine is clearly not a democracy. \n\n\t Yet, outright fraud and media abuse appears to have been surprisingly limited .\u00a0 While state TV displayed a \u201cclear bias in favor of the ruling party,\u201d the much more popular private stations \u2013 Inter, 1+1, and ICTV provided \u201cbalanced\u201d coverage of the competing parties. (These three stations account for about a third of TV viewers in Ukraine, while state TV, UT1 , accounts for 3-4 percent. The private pro Yanukovych \u201cUkraine\u201d channel accounts for about 5 percent). \u00a0Serious problems with Ukrainian media remain.\u00a0 Corruption is rife, major outlets lack editorial autonomy and coverage of the campaign was mostly limited. As a result, parties had to rely on paid advertising and thus required significant resources to compete.\u00a0\u00a0 Nonetheless in Yanukovych\u2019s Ukraine, opposition parties so far have significant access to major media outlets.\u00a0 The situation is a far cry from 2004 when most outlets were \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d imbalanced in favor of Yanukovych . \n\n\t Simultaneously, the evidence so far suggests that outright vote stealing was also relatively limited in this election.\u00a0 Thus, the proportional vote \u2013 which gave the Party of Regions about thirty percent of the vote; and Tymoshenko\u2019s Fatherland Party a quarter \u2013 was directly in line with exit polls .\u00a0 The next few days will almost certainly reveal more evidence of fraud in the single member districts, where the ruling party has done much better (and which account for half of the legislature).\u00a0 However, most estimates at the time of writing (October 30) suggest that overall the Party of Regions will have direct control over about 40 percent of the legislature \u2013 high by Ukrainian standards, but low compared to Russia and other semi authoritarian countries.\u00a0 Even accounting for the fact that the government \u2013 with its vast resources \u2013 will certainly be able to bribe its way to a majority, the Party of Regions is unlikely to be able to gain a constitutional majority. \n\n\t In sum, Yanukovych has concentrated power in Ukraine and destroyed the democratic legacy of the Orange revolution with remarkable ease.\u00a0 \u00a0Yet, the most recent vote suggests that elections still allow for meaningful \u2013 if highly unfair \u2013 competition. Ukraine is a hybrid or competitive authoritarian regime .\u00a0 Yanukovych is no Putin or Lukashenka. Such silver linings are worth noting.
