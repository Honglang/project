Unsurprisingly, the viva went very well, with laudatory reports. His thesis is a collection of 5(!) papers he co-wrote, including Free energy SMC, SMC\u00b2, Block independent Methopolis-Hastings, Parallel Adaptive Wang-Landau (my personal favourite), and our collaboration on the Wang-Landau Flat Histogram . \n I have been impressed not only by the quality of Pierre\u2019s work, but also by his ability to start collaborations with many different researchers all around the world (co-authors in 6 countries already). He is now moving to Singapore for a postdoc with Ajay Jasra and has started a handful of very interesting projects, so there is much more to be expected!"], "link": "http://robinryder.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/pierre-jacobs-viva/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://robinryder.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "https://sites.google.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Robin Ryder's blog"}, {"content": ["Wikipedia is awesome, and we all rely on it on a day-to-day basis. For basic statistical topics, I usually find it very reliable. For more advanced topics, however, coverage is often sketchy or even non-existent. The article on ABC is exceedingly short; the one on the Wang-Landau algorithm is rather odd; the on on quantitative comparative linguistics is essentially a long list. \n I often get annoyed when people complain about Wikipedia, for two reasons: 1. Although imperfect, it is pretty good, and often better than other more widely accepted general knowledge encyclopedias; 2. If you find a problem, you should fix it rather than complain. \n Although I am far from being the most active contributor on Wikipedia, I edit it quite a lot, and am an administrator of Wikimedia Commons. But I have hardly done any contributions in Statistics, my area of expertise. The reason is simple: when I do Statistics, it is for my job, do I either do research or prepare lectures. Editing Wikipedia is a hobby, so I want it to be separate from my job. \n But this is sub-optimal: Wikipedia could be improved if more specialists were to participate. Also, and I should try not to be too depressed by this, anything I write on Wikipedia will probably be read thousands time more than the scientific papers I write. One could thus argue that it would be an efficient use of my time for me and other statisticians to edit Wikipedia on Statistics topics. One could even go further and state that it should be one of our duties. \n There are several obstacles here. The first obstacle is that Wikipedia\u2019s model is that it can be edited by anyone; other encyclopedias which attempt to have articles written by specialists are nowhere near as successful (e.g. Citizendium). Some kind of assurance that an expert\u2019s edits are given more importance than a layman\u2019s could incentivize more experts to participate. I actually believe that in the large majority of cases, an expert\u2019s contribution would be recognized as such and that no one would try to deconstruct it (most exceptions would be in topics subject to hot debate either in the scientific community or in the media). A second obstacle is that editing Wikipedia is not recognized in the career path of scientists: I might want scientists in general to participate in Wikipedia; but I won\u2019t do it, because I really need to finish these three papers and grant proposals (a kind of NIMBY issue). A third obstacle is that scientists simply cannot be bothered to edit Wikipedia. \n PLoS Computational Biology has started an initiative to address these obstacles. In a nutshell: scientists write a review paper. It gets published in the journal, and the scientists get a publication on their CV. At the same time, the paper gets copied over to Wikipedia. The initial version is marked as being written by specialists, but anyone can edit it (e.g. improve the wording, add relevant links, etc.). Everyone wins. The first such article is on Circular permutation in proteins . \n Obviously, scientists should also edit Wikipedia even when they don\u2019t get a publication out of it. But such initiatives will help get scientists involved. Explaining scientific topics to the general public is one of the duties of scientists, and Wikipedia is one of the best tools to do this."], "link": "http://robinryder.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/plos-scientific-paper-gets-also-published-on-wikipedia/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://blogs.plos.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 5}, "blogtitle": "Robin Ryder's blog"}, {"content": ["MCMC practitioners may be familiar with the Wang-Landau algorithm, which is widely used in Physics. This algorithm divides the sample space into \u201cboxes\u201d. Given a target distribution, the algorithm then samples proportionally to the target in each box, while aiming at spending a pre-defined proportion of the sample in each box. (Usually these predefined proportions are uniform.) \n This strategy can help move faster between modes of a distribution, by forcing the sample to visit often the space between modes. \n The most sophisticated versions of this algorithm combine a decreasing stochastic schedule and the so-called flat histogram criterion: whenever the proportions of the sample in each box are close enough to the desired frequencies, the stochastic schedule decreases. A decreasing schedule is necessary for diminishing adaptation to hold. \n Until now, it was unknown whether the flat histogram is necessarily reached in finite time, and hence whether the schedule ever starts decreasing. \n Pierre Jacob and I just submitted and arXived a proof that the flat histogram is reached in finite time under some conditions, and may never be reached in other cases."], "link": "http://robinryder.wordpress.com/2011/10/19/the-wang-landau-algorithm-reaches-the-flat-histogram-in-finite-time/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://arxiv.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://statisfaction.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Robin Ryder's blog"}, {"content": ["As of this month, I am no longer a postdoc, but an assistant professor ( ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences ) at Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine . \n My new contact details are: \n Robin Ryder \n Bureau C608 \n CEREMADE \u2212 Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine \n Place du Mar\u00e9chal de Lattre de Tassigny \n 75116 Paris \n Phone: (+33) 1 44 05 46 71 \n My e-mail is unchanged."], "link": "http://robinryder.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/new-position/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.dauphine.fr": 1}, "blogtitle": "Robin Ryder's blog"}, {"content": ["The Greek Stochastics \u03b3 conference was held last week in Crete and focused this year on MCMC methods ( last year was of statistics for biology). The schedule allowed little time for presentations from participants, but there were several \u201cshort courses\u201d. In particular, Gareth Roberts gave a rather illuminating explanation on convergence of Gibbs samplers, in which each step of the sampler is viewed as a projection in a functional space. \n In a Gibb s sampler with two steps (1. update given ; 2. update given ), step 1 is a projection (recall that is a projection iff , and it is clear than performing step 1 twice in a row is the same as performing it only once); the same is true of step 2. The spaces we are projecting on are ugly, but if you view them as lines, it is easy to see that the successive iterations converge to the intersection of the two lines, which corresponds to a fixed point, as shown in this very ugly figure. The convergence is faster if the two lines are\u00a0 close to orthogonal, which corresponds to correlation close to in the Gibbs sampler. Apparently, this line of thought was initiated by Yael Amit. I find it very helpful. \n Another fascinating talk was given by David Spiegelhalter (the \u201cgeneral interest\u201d talk), on communicating in Statistics. David studies the question \u201cWhy do people find probability unintuitive and difficult?\u201d; he suggests that the answer in \u201cbecause probability in unintuitive and difficult\u201d. He gave a startling example: in a phone survey, if you ask which is the greater risk between 1/100, 1/10 and 1/1000, about 25-30% of people give the wrong answer. Media reports often use such notation, with the numerator fixed to 1. The message would be better understood if probabilities were given with a fixed denominator (1/100, 10/100, 0.1/100).

Of the leading publications, La Recherche will feature an interview with yours truly in March, and Pour la Science has an 8-page cover story on the subject in the current issue. \n Popularizer Ruth Berger looks at the expansion of the Indo-Europeans from genetic and linguistic points of view, trying to reconcile them and to decide between the Kurgan (horsemen) and Anatolian (farmers) possible origins of Indo-European expansion. For the linguistics half, she looks at phylogenetic models to infer genealogies and dates, but skips the methodology and reproduces directly trees by Gray & Atkinson (2003) and Atkinson et al. (2005). \n It is a shame that the method is presented as a black box. Given the length of the article, it would have been possible to give a general idea of how dates are inferred: the ages of parts of the tree are known, and this information is used to estimate rates of change and other ages. Instead, the author suggests that the rates are already known [whence?] and are fed to the black box, which magically outputs a tree and dates.\u00a0 There is barely anything about the uncertainty of the estimates, and nothing about validation. I also have trouble understanding the points made at the end about Linear A and the attempt to merge the Anatolian and Kurgan hypotheses. \n This issue is number 400 of Pour la Science . According to the editor-in-chief, they decided to celebrate with an issue on \u201ctheories and models\u201d.
