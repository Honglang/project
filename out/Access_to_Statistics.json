Against this background, the recent phenomenon of an emergence of \u201cbig data\u201d including data from official and non-official sources such as call logs, mobile-banking transactions, polling results, online user-generated content, satellite images, etc. should be very welcome. But, there is an emerging concern that big data might also lead to very important negative consequences such as the publishing of data of bad quality and without any accountability mechanism, a possibly confusion of the public by showing different data depending on the sources and most importantly on under-mining if not crowding out the statistical capacity at country level, in particular in developing countries. In this context, PARIS21 has organised a lunch-time seminar to address how development practioners can maximize the opportunities and minimize the risks coming from the big data movement for building statistical capacities in developing countries.  The seminar, which was attended by around 50 participants, took place on the 17th of October in the framework of the 4th OECD World Forum on Statistics, Knowledge and Policy in New Delhi, India which started on the 16th of October and will last till the 19th. It was a lively debate discussing issues around data production \u2013 public versus private ; data quality \u2013 good or bad and the need for institutional frameworks that define the role of each action in the statistical landscape. The debate was moderated by Johannes J\u00dcTTING, Manager of PARIS21 Secretariat, with a panel composed of Mohamed TAAMOUTI, Director of the Moroccan Statistics Office and Robert MANCHIN, Managing Director of The Gallup Organisation Europe.

This information, called basic data, is re-used throughout the public sector. Re-use of high-quality data is an essential basis for public authorities to perform their tasks properly and efficiently across units, administrations and sectors. Basic data is an important contribution to modernising the public sector. The public and businesses are provided a better and more efficient service, when data that has already been recorded is shared across institutions and is included directly in case processing. Furthermore, employees in the public sector will be less burdened by repetitive and routine tasks, and this, in turn, will release more resources for increased welfare in e.g. the healthcare and education sectors. However, open and homogenous re-use of basic data also has great value for the private sector, partly because businesses use this data in their internal processes and, partly, because the information contained in public-sector data can be exploited for entirely new products and solutions, in particular digital ones. In short, basic data freely available to the private sector is a potential driver for innovation, growth and job creation.

Spotfire 5.0, a significant upgrade announced on Tuesday, is designed to do all of the above at big-data scale. Tibco Spotfire is already a popular product for finding the proverbial needles in the haystack, but customers are telling Tibco that the haystacks are getting bigger. Oil and gas operations, for example, are gathering more information from well sensors. Manufacturers are grabbing more production data off of shop floors. And marketers are gathering more customer analysis and segmentation information through click streams and social networks. As the data stacks up, the nature of the analysis changes, according to Steve Farr, a Tibco Spotfire senior product marketing manager. \"It's tempting to think you can identify the important trends in a small subset of the data, but big data analytics is about considering all of the data so you also see the exceptions and outliers,\" Farr told InformationWeek. \"It's in the outliers that you find fraud, risk, and the things that are growing wrong.\" You can also find latent patterns in that bigger picture that reveal opportunities.

Further, background information will not be taken into account. That is what led us to the idea of applying data-mining methods that we had been studying here to the semantic web in order to obtain further, background infor\u00adma\u00adtion that will allow us to learn more from statistics.\" The \"Explain-a-LOD\" tool that Paulheim developed accesses linked open data (LOD), i.e., enormous compilations of publicly available, semantically linked data accessible on the Internet, and, from that data, automatically formulates hypo\u00adtheses regarding the interpretation of arbitrary types of statistics. To start off, the statistics to be interpreted are read into Explain-a-LOD. Explain-a-LOD then automatically searches the pools of linked open data for associated records and adds them to the initial set. Paulheim explained that, \"If, for example, the country \"Germany\" is listed in the corruption-index data, LOD\u2011records that contain information on Germany will be identified and further attributes, such as its population, its membership in the EU and OECD, or the total number of companies domiciled there, generated.
