Until now, this blog has been about the business of genomics. From next week, the scope of Seqonomics will be wider and also include topics associated with personalised medicine other than genomics. Expect posts on electronic health record systems, health IT, pharmacogenomics, and metabolomics. But don't worry if you liked my previous genomics-and-business posts: There'll be plenty more of those as well.      Welcome on board  Why this change? I have come to the conclusion that it is a mistake to consider genomics in isolation without taking into account all the other disruptive changes that are happening in medicine. Working in genomics, it is easy to misjudge how, and how much, genomics impacts medicine compared to other innovations. This is why from now on, Seqonomics will not just be about genomics, but about personalised medicine in general.  The one thing that is not going to change is that I'll keep approaching all topics from a business angle. To reflect this, the tagline of Seqonomics is going to change from The Economics of Genome Sequencing to The Economics of Personalised Medicine ."], "link": "http://seqonomics.blogspot.com/feeds/1865423899877227730/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://3.blogspot.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Seqonomics"}, {"content": ["The Ultimate Generation Sequencer.

That Complete Genomics is being acquired could have been expected, but that the buyer is the BGI may come as a surprise.  Complete Genomics' technology is well regarded , and their business model is unique in the industry. Rather than building sequencing machines and selling them, they offer sequencing as a service. This means that researchers, and potentially clinicians as well, send their samples to the company and receive the sequence data back without ever having to enter a lab.  The reason why Complete Genomics has chosen this path is probably that their technology benefits from economies of scale, which would not be applicable otherwise.  Complete Genomics charges around $5,000 to sequence a human genome, which is a fair price considering that researchers save the capital cost associated with purchasing a sequencing machine, and the hassle of acquiring the expertise to run them.    Nevertheless, Complete Genomics has been struggling financially for some time. They have not been profitable in any period since they were formed , and instead they incurred significant quarterly losses that showed no sign of improvement. This depressed their share price, and as a result made it more likely that they would eventually be taken over.  Why is Complete Genomics doing this?  The advantage for Complete Genomics of being bought by the BGI is that they're not going to go bust. Understandably, the board of Complete Genomics decided against playing hard to get and has accepted BGI's offer of \u00a33.15 per share, which is 18% more than the share's closing price the previous business day. Not all shareholders are happy about this . Some strongly feel that $3.15 is not enough , although most analysts seem to disagree with that.  Why is the BGI doing this?  If Complete Genomics' motivation for this deal is clear, there are at least two potential motivations for the BGI. The first one is that they are currently dependent on Illumina's sequencing technology. Access to Complete Genomics technology will ease that dependency, and enable them to offer additional value to their current customers.  Secondly, although they are the market leader in research services , their presence in the United States is not as strong as it could be. Access to Complete Genomics' customer list will help them to expand their presence in that crucial market.  Is this good or bad for the market as a whole?  Considering that Complete Genomics in the medium term would have kept struggling, and in the long run may well have gone out of business, this deal is probably beneficial to customers. It means that Complete Genomics technology will still be available , as the company is likely to continue its operations based at its current Silicon Valley headquarters.

State capitalism has also been particularly good at producing national champions that can compete globally.  The BGI , formerly known as Beijing Genomics Institute, is a great example of this. It is by far the largest sequencing centre in the world, and it is busy expanding overseas. It is currently establishing subsidiaries in Copenhagen , Sacramento, and Philadelphia, and it has deals with companies and research centres around the world.  One reason for its success is that it can sequence more economically that others. This is probably due to economies of scale, but also because it benefits from government subsidies such as a $1.6bn line of credit from the China Development Bank .    The BGI dominates Chinese genomics. According to Omics Maps , there are 201 next generation sequencing machines in the country. 83 percent of those are owned by the BGI.  Which is not to say that there aren't any other genomics companies. Shanghai Biochip, also trading as Shanghai Bio Corporation , is one of them. It offers diagnostic products, research supplies, and research services that include DNA sequencing. Its English website also has a section on personal genetic testing, although this is still under construction.  A second example of a Chinese genomics company is Beijing Berry Genomics , which performs pre-natal diagnosis by sequencing. It is financed by Legend, a Chinese venture capital firm that is also a controlling shareholder of the computer manufacturer Lenovo . The company develops technology that can detect trisomy 21 and other chromosomal abnormalities in foetuses during pregnancy. It seems that it is using a sequencing-based method that is similar to that of market leader Sequenom .  Overall, there is plenty of government investment in genomics and in particular in sequencing in China, and at least for the BGI, the investment seems to pay off for the time being. The ultimate test of this will however be whether the BGI will be able to pay back its $1.6bn loan when it is due in 2020.  Update On September 17th, the BGI agreed to buy the sequencing company Complete Genomics for $118, affirming its dominance of the sequencing services field.

Eric Topol's The Creative Destruction of Medicine is a book for genomicists who want to know what's going on in health care innovation outside of genomics. It's also a book for everyone else working in a health-related field who wants to understand the changes that are happening in medicine right now outside of their specialisation.  The central thesis of the book is that there are several areas of innovation in medicine - genomics, wireless sensors, health IT, social networking, and novel ways of assessing drug efficacy - that could each have a large impact, but that together they could change medicine beyond recognition.  There are many parts of The Creative Destruction of Medicine that are excellent. The section on large clinical trials as an out-dated way of assessing drug efficacy and safety is one of them. Topol thinks that conditional approval would be a better alternative: Drugs that can reasonably be assumed to be safe are initially tested on a small group of patients under strictl regulation. The regulatory agency has the right to withdraw the conditional approval at any time, and only once a reasonably large dataset has been collected does the drug gain full approval.  Topol clearly loves his medical gadgets. I was amazed by some of the ones he describes, like a pocketable ultrasound device that allows imaging the heart in real time and that may soon replace that symbol of the medical profession, the stethoscope. My biggest complaint is that parts of the book are not entirely relevant to its central topic and have probably only been included because they are of interest to the author. For example, Topol is clearly passionate about the dangers posed by the ionising radiation that come with excessive use of medical imaging technology such as CT scans, but two chapters on this are too much.     If you wonder whether The Creative Destruction of Medicine is for you, here are the most important facts:  Areas covered: The convergence of wireless sensors, genomics, information systems, mobile connectivity, internet, social networking, and computing power. Basically anything that has to do with personalised medicine  Who it is for: Doctors and anyone else working in healthcare, including researchers. As someone working in genomics, I felt that the book did an excellent job of putting genomics into perspective  Who it is not for: This book is not a guide for patients to personalised medicine. Some of topics, such as the challenges of compatibility between different proprietary Health IT systems, will be less applicable to Europe than to the United States  How much it costs: The recommended retail price for the hardcover is $27.99, but online the book is available for $15.58. The Kindle edition is a bit more expensive and costs $15.73.  If you think you're going to buy this book, do so sooner rather than later: The rate of progress in medicine means that it'll be out-dated in a year.

Within the United States, it is striking that the money goes to the two states where most of the research is done: California and Massachusetts. The dominance of California is particularly remarkable: It's not just IT startups that rule in the Golden State.   These figures should be taken with a pinch of salt. Crunchbase may be biased towards listing more Silicon Valley and American companies (Genomics companies from outside of North America and Europe don't figure at all).

The threat to fire someone unless they have some brilliant ideas is unlikely to motivate them in the desired way.  When it comes to the commercialisation of genomics, there is a lot of pressure to come up with new things. Those working in the field feel that genomics has enormous potential. For those observing genomics from the outside, there is often a vague sense that so far it has failed to deliver.  For both those within the field and outside of it there seems to be a consensus that if genomics is to become an ubiquitous technology, it will be because of its widespread adoption in healthcare.  I would like to suggest that most progress in the commercialisation of genomics may come from somewhere else entirely. Possibly from somewhere unexpected where there is less pressure to deliver and less competition, allowing for more creativity. Besides that, healthcare is one of the most strictly regulated industries, making innovation even less likely.    There are several applications of genomics outside of healthcare that show great promise. One of them, forensics, I reviewed in a blog post two week ago .  An even more harmless area is what could be called the genomics of irrelevance: There are plenty of genetic variants that predict things that no-one cares about. Examples include whether your pee smells differently after you eat asparagus, whether you earwax is runny, or whether you feel the urge to sneeze when looking into the sun.

As I spend my days working in the field, I prefer to spend my nights reading about other things. This means that I have not read a popular science book on genomics since Matt Ridley's fantastic Genome .  For Elizabeth Finkel's The Genome Generation I made an exception, and I do not regret it. Finkel writes beautifully, knows the subject, and is never boring - in other words, she is a good science writer.

Although her identity was not known, it was clear that she was dangerous: DNA evidence from 40 crime scenes, including several murder scenes, could be linked to her.  Despite immense efforts lasting more than two years, they did not succeed. Eventually, they had to admit that the reason why they had found DNA from the same woman in all those crime scenes was that the cotton swabs used in the investigation were all contaminated by the same cotton swab factory worker .  This episode of forensic history illustrates how much law enforcement has come to rely on DNA evidence. The centrepiece of this effort are national DNA databases, which have acronyms like CODIS (USA), NDNAD (UK), or FNAEG (France). Each of those databases contains millions of unique DNA profiles. Whilst DNA is central to modern forensics, DNA sequencing is not: The profiles in the databases are obtained using capillary electrophoresis of polymorphic loci called VNTRs . Is this likely to change with the arrival of more affordable sequencers?     Arthur Eisenberg, who established one of the world's first forensics labs, thinks so. In a recent interview published on Genomeweb , he envisages a future where all forensic DNA testing is done using sequencing.  More widespread use of sequencing in forensics could have a number of benefits. Firstly, sequencing would return information on DNA polymorphisms other than just VNTRs. This includes SNPs , which are much more common than VNTRs. SNPs are informative of traits like eye colour, hair colour, and race, and could be used for facial composites (although this would not be legal in some countries, including Germany).  Another advantage of sequencing is that it can be applied to a wider range of forensic samples than VNTR profiling. Shed hair is recovered from a lot of crime scenes, but cannot be analysed using VNTR profiling because it usually does not contain nuclear DNA. It does however contain mitochondrial DNA , which is already used for forensic investigations.  A major challenge for sequencing is backwards compatibility. Existing VNTR-based forensic databases already have millions of entries, which are not easily comparable to the output of most next generation sequencing (NGS) machines. The reason is that NGS sequencers can typically only read 100-200 bases at a time, whilst for gaining reliable information on VNTRs read lengths of 400 bases or more are required. This is likely to become less of a problem in the next few years, as read lengths increase.  Another remaining challenge is that NGS is not sufficiently reproducible to be admitted as evidence in a court of law. The same barrier exists for the widespread adoption of NGS in the clinic, where reproducibility is essential as well, but cannot yet be demonstrated for NGS-based tests either. In summary, the hurdles for the widespread adoption of DNA sequencing in forensics seem to be technical, and solvable.

Although businesses providing sequencing services dominate (the BGI, Macrogen , DNAVision , Shanghai Biochip , Beckman Coulter Genomics , GATC , Takara , and Genotypic fall into this category), there are also agribusiness companies ( Monsanto and Keygene ) and health care providers (the Mayo Clinic and SAIC-Frederick ).

However, the only commercial attempt to capitalise on this founder population was by a company called Genizon, which failed last year.

Three of those companies - Complete Genomics, Pacific Biosciences, and Intelligent Bio-Systems - have revenues that are negligible compared to the size of the overall NGS market. Their combined sales amount to less than 3% of the total, and current trends do not indicate rapid growth for any of them.  Estimating the market share of the other three companies is trickier, as they also have business outside of sequencing. Neither of them breaks out its NGS revenues in its financial statements.  Based on the financial information that is available, Roche probably earned revenues of less than $100m from its 454 sequencing technology in 2011. This would be equivalent to 10% of the market or less, and is set to decline even more if recent trends are anything to go by.

However, many DTC tests have not been validated by medical professionals. This means that in the best case quality cannot be assured, and in the worst case, that they could be bogus. Wrong test results could have a large impact, and therefore most experts call for more regulatory oversight of how and by whom these tests can be provided.  In the United States, although the regulatory position of DTC genetic testing varies between states, there is also relevant federal legislation, such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act .    Regulation of genetic testing in Europe. Source: Borry et al . 2012, European Journal of Human Genetics  Less so in Europe. In a recent publication in the European Journal of Human Genetics , Pascal Borry and coworkers discuss the regulatory framework in seven European countries.  DTC genetic testing is not an area that is directly legislated by EU. Instead, each country draws up its own laws, and there is hardly any harmonisation between them. The result is that in some countries, such as Belgium or the United Kingdom, there is hardly any regulation of DTC genetic testing, whilst in others, it is strongly regulated - sometimes to the extent that non-medical and non-research genetic testing is explicitly banned.  The result is that European companies providing DTC genetic testing would have a hard time taking advantage of the EU's common market. Could this be a reason why there are no large European DTC genetic testing companies that I am aware of?"], "link": "http://seqonomics.blogspot.com/feeds/1253869647636280281/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://4.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 2, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Seqonomics"}, {"content": ["There are at least a dozen companies that claim to develop new DNA sequencing technology.

Companies that have not yet made a public announcement on a potential release date but have attracted substantial investment are Nabsys ($17m funding), GnuBio ($8m funding), Stratos ($7m funding), and possibly LaserGen ($5m funding).    Companies that are thought to develop sequencing technology but that have attracted less investment, or whose finances are unknown, are Noblegen , Base 4 Innovation , Electron Optica , Halcyon , Lightspeed Genomics , and ZS Genetics . Of these, clear signs of activity only come from Noblegen, with a rumoured 2014 release data, and Base 4, which has recently started a recruitment drive.  Whether Base 4 is actually developing sequencing technology is not entirely clear. Their website only hints at single-molecule detection platforms, whilst at least one third-party website also mentions solid-state DNA sequencing.  If only half of these companies are successful in developing a commercially viable product and join the six companies that are already sell next generation sequencers (Illumina, Life Technologies, Roche, Complete Genomics, Pacific Biosciences, Intelligent BioSystems), it is going to be a crowded marketplace.

Until around five years ago, the Icelandic company was once one of the hottest firms in the field. Then, in 2009, it made headlines by spectacularly going bust. Nowadays, a company with the same name still exists, but not very much is being said or written about it.  DeCODE was founded in 1996 to find the genetic causes of diseases. Soon it started publishing its results in high-profile papers, and its future looked bright enough for an IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2000. However, it never made a profit, and after some years DeCode was delisted from the NASDAQ again. A few months after that, in November 2009, it declared bankruptcy.     What went wrong? One examplanation is that DeCODE was a victim of the financial crisis that started in 2008. It did not help that $33m of DeCODE's money was managed by Lehman Brothers , and that the company was headquartered in Iceland, which was particularly hard hit by the crisis.  However, DeCODE had already struggled financially before the crisis. The bigger contributor to DeCODE's downfall was probably that is has turned out harder than expected to monetarise the company\u2019s excellent science. It developed a few drug leads, but the most promising lead was suspended in 2006 due to manufacturing problems.  What is DeCODE currently up to? In January 2010, it was purchased by a consortium that includes Polaris Ventures and ARCH Venture Partners , two investors specialising in the life sciences.  The company now focuses exclusively on research . Their website sporadically announces the discovery of variants linked to disease, often in collaboration with other organisations. One such collaboration is with Pfizer , which seems to provide DeCODE with some income. Other sources of income are grants from the NIH  and the European Union.  The morale?

An excellent reason for me to continue a series on genomics in different countries, which has already covered Japan and Germany .   In June 2000, the first draft of the human genome was completed. The contribution of France was 3% of the total . That was little, but still more than the contribution of any other country except the United States and the UK. At the time, all of the sequencing in France was done by its national sequencing centre, the Genoscope near Paris.    According to Balzac, political liberty, the peace of a nation, and science itself are gifts for which fate demands a heavy tax in blood     Since then, genomics has become even less of a national priority, and other countries have overtaken France. In terms of sequencing infrastructure, France lags behind its European peers Germany and the UK. According to Omics Maps , there are 38 sequencing machines in France, compared to Germany's 135 and the UK's 138.   There are some signs that this could change. Last year, French genomics, including the Genoscope sequencing centre, received a funding boost of \u20ac60m ($77m) as a part of a \u20ac260m package to promote research infrastructure. It is too early to tell whether this has been a one-off, or whether there is a long-term commitment by French policymakers to invest more in genomics. Doing a quick press search, I could not find any indication what the views of France's new minister of Higher Education and Research on genomics are.   How about the private sector? France has biotech giants such as Biom\u00e9rieux and Eurofins that are also involved in sequencing. However, the core business of both companies is not genomics. That is unlikely to change: In a recent interview , Eurofins senior vice president Bruno Poddevin expressed the opinion that it will take at least another 10 years until Sanger sequencing is replaced by next generation sequencing (NGS), and that until then, NGS will not be a priority for his company.   Overall, it seems that sequencing is not a priority for either the public or the private sector in France. If you have any comments that confirm or refute this view, please share them below.

In an excellent article appearing together with the publication I discussed last week , Isaac Kohane and Jay Shendure argue that the cost of whole genome sequencing per year is only $13, and that any health benefits derived from it that are worth more than $13 per year would therefore make sequencing a good investment. They arrive at $13 by dividing the $1,000 that sequencing someone may cost by the life expectancy of the average American , which is 78 years.     However, this does not take into account all the other things you could do with the $1,000 you spend on sequencing, like investing it. Corrected for that , the real cost is more like $61 per year.  It is not at all obvious that for most people, and for the foreseeable future, the best way to spend $61 a year will be to get sequenced. For the same money, you could get a lot of other regular checkups that have a greater utility .  In any case, my calculation may be besides the point: Right now, it is unclear whether having your genome sequenced and analysed will eventually cost the same than a CT scan, or a multiple, or a fraction of that.  How do I arrive at $61 per year?  Like Kohane and Shendure, I assume that having your genome sequenced and analysed in a meaningful way will be around $1,000. Investing this money at a conservative rate of 6% after inflation for 78 years, which is the life expectancy of an average American, means that the equivalent of $1,000 now is $61 (plus inflation adjustments) for the next 78 years, and not $13."], "link": "http://seqonomics.blogspot.com/feeds/4915091890972047676/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://seqonomics.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.annals.org/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 3, "http://stm.sciencemag.org/": 1, "http://2.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.co.uk/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Seqonomics"}, {"content": ["Like everyone else, public health insurances only have a limited amount of money, and therefore constantly need to make decisions which treatments to fund, and which are too expensive . That way, some treatments, although they have a health benefit, do not get funded, because they cost too much, and the money instead goes to treatments with a higher utility .  This applies to drugs, but also to diagnostic tests. From the point of view of insurers, genome sequencing is just another such test. The question then is, is it the best way to spend health insurance money?    A new door may be a better way to spend your money   In a recent publication in the journal Science Translational Medicine , Nicholas Roberts and coworkers partially address this question. They estimate the potential of whole genome sequencing to provide clinically useful information on the disease risk of people who are currently healthy.  Their result: Even in the best of circumstances, for most people sequencing will be uninformative about their risk for the majority of common diseases.  However, they also find that there is also a good chance that sequencing will provide useful information about at least one disease. This means that if you are particularly concerned about getting a specific disease, sequencing will probably not tell you anything new. On the other hand, it might well warn you about your risk of developing a disease you never even thought of before. But even then, the predictive value is likely to be quite limited.  This is interesting, but as the authors acknowledge, it comes with some caveats. Firstly, it covers only common diseases. For diseases that are caused by single genes, sequencing is much more likely to give useful results. Also, it assumes that people are sequenced after their birth, whilst some of the value of sequencing lies with prenatal diagnosis . It also ignores the possibility of sequencing only those people who are most likely to benefit, such as those that already show certain symptoms.  In summary, Nicholas Roberts and his colleagues pour cold water on the idea that sequencing everyone is going to have a large impact on how disease risks for common diseases are assessed for asymptomatic patients. On the more important question of whether sequencing everyone will be worth the cost in clinical practice, the jury is still out.  In next week's post, I will attempt to answer the related question of what the utility of sequencing needs to be in order to offset its cost."], "link": "http://seqonomics.blogspot.com/feeds/7340637954885831069/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://stm.sciencemag.org/": 1, "http://seqonomics.co.uk/": 1, "http://www.wisc.edu/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 3, "http://1.blogspot.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Seqonomics"}, {"content": ["This week, I take another look at venture capital (VC) investments in genomics.
