What is FRPAA, and what\u2019s it trying to accomplish? \n Thank you, Michael \u2013 I\u2019m happy to talk about this bill! \n In a nutshell, FRPAA is designed to make sure that the results of scientific research paid for by the public can be accessed by the public.\u00a0Most people are surprised to learn that this isn\u2019t automatically the case;\u00a0they assume that if their tax dollars pay for a research study, they\u00a0should be entitled to read the results. \u00a0But the reality is quite\u00a0different. \u00a0Right now, if you want to access articles that report on\u00a0publicly funded science, you have pay to do so, either through a subscription to a scientific journal (which can cost thousands of dollars\u00a0a year), or though pay-per-view, which can easily cost upwards of $30 per\u00a0article. This presents an often-unsurmountable obstacle for exactly those\u00a0people who most want (or need) access \u2013 scientists, students, teachers,\u00a0physicians, entrepreneurs \u2013 who too often find themselves unable to afford\u00a0such fees, and end up locked out of the game. \n Out of eleven federal agencies that fund science here in the United\u00a0States, only one \u2013 the National Institutes of Health \u2013 actually has a\u00a0policy that ensures that the public can freely access the results of their\u00a0funded research online. FRPAA is designed to tackle this issue head on,\u00a0and to make sure that the science stemming from all U.S. agencies is made\u00a0freely available to anyone who wants to use. it. \n FRPAA is a very straightforward bill \u2013 it simply says that if you receive\u00a0money from a U.S. Agency to do scientific research, you agree (upfront) to\u00a0make any articles reporting on the results available to the public in a\u00a0freely accessible online database, no later than six months after\u00a0publication in a peer-reviewed journal. \n Q: What is the Alliance for Taxpayer Access (ATA)?\u00a0What role did the ATA play in advocating for FRPAA? \n The ATA is a coalition of groups who are working together to try and craft\u00a0a positive solution to this problem. \u00a0In 2004, the library community (led by my home organization, SPARC) decided that there must be other groups\u00a0who shared our frustration over the current access situation. We reached\u00a0out to research organizations, patient advocacy groups, consumer organizations, publishers, student groups \u2013 anyone we could think of who\u00a0shared the goal of unlocking access to taxpayer funded research. \u00a0We\u00a0quickly attracted more than 80 organizations, representing millions of\u00a0individuals. This created a whole new opportunity to advocate for national\u00a0access policies from a much stronger position\u2026 there really is \u00a0strength in numbers! \n The ATA has evolved into the leading advocacy organization for taxpayer\u00a0access to the results of taxpayer funded research. We knock on Congressional doors, talking with policymakers about \u00a0the current barriers \u00a0to access, and about new opportunities for scientific progress once those barriers are brought down.\u00a0We are all about leveraging\u00a0the public\u2019s investment in science by making sure that anyone who is\u00a0interested can easily access and build on this research. That\u2019s how\u00a0science advances, after all. \n Q: In 2008, the Congress passed the NIH public access\u00a0policy. \u00a0Can you tell us about that, and the ATA\u2019s role? \n Absolutely! \u00a0As I mentioned, the NIH is currently the only U.S. agency\u00a0that has a policy guaranteeing the public access to the results of its\u00a0funded research. The idea for the policy surfaced in 2003, when Congress\u00a0expressed concern that results of the public\u2019s nearly $30 billion annual\u00a0investment in NIH research were not being made as widely accessible as\u00a0they should be. \u00a0They asked the NIH Director to create a policy to address\u00a0the problem, setting in motion what would become 4 long years of intense\u00a0debate in the scientific community.\u00a0 \n Not surprisingly, some journal publishers expressed immediate concern that\u00a0any policy that provided access to research results through any other\u00a0channels other than subscription-based journals would irreparably damage\u00a0their businesses. Because journal publishing is big business (nearly $9\u00a0billion in annual revenues) publishers were able to use their\u00a0long-established trade associations to aggressively lobby the NIH and\u00a0Congress against the establishment of such a policy. \n The scientists, librarians, patients, and others who favored the policy\u00a0found themselves at a disadvantage, advocating as individual organizations\u00a0without a coordinated voice. This was the main reason the ATA was\u00a0established, and we quickly found ourselves at the center of the debate,\u00a0helping to ensure that all stakeholders who favored the establishment of a\u00a0public access policy had a way to present a united message to\u00a0policymakers. Ultimately, Congress passed a landmark policy fully\u00a0supported by the ATA that was enacted in 2008.\u00a0 \n Q: Who works at the ATA? \n The ATA is essentially a virtual coalition. While we\u2019ve grown to represent\u00a0over 100 organizations, the organization\u2019s advocacy is carried out by a\u00a0pretty small core group of staff (all of whom have other full time jobs!) \u00a0Besides myself, the wonderful Nick Shockey and Andrea\u00a0Higginbotham are responsible for the coalition\u2019s online presence \u2013 keeping\u00a0our website up to date,\u00a0maintaining our Congressional Action Center , and keeping our members looped in on various email\u00a0lists. \u00a0We also rely on our incredibly active members to help us\u00a0continually refine our messages, and look for opportunities to spread the\u00a0word about our work. \u00a0People like Sharon Terry at the Genetic Alliance , Prue Adler at the Association of Research Libraries , and Pat\u00a0Furlong at Parent\u00a0Project Muscular Dystrophy are prime examples of some of the people\u00a0who keep the ATA active on the front lines. Also: there is no cost to join the ATA (SPARC picks up the relatively low\u00a0tab to keep it humming!); and the door is open for any organization to sign on as a member through our website . If you\u2019re interested, please let us\u00a0know! \n Q: What happens next, with FRPAA? \u00a0How does it\u00a0(hopefully) become law? What could derail it? \n The next steps for FRPAA will be for us (and our advocates) to encourage\u00a0other members of Congress to sign onto the bill as co-sponsors. Generating\u00a0a nice, robust list of supporting members of Congress is key in helping to\u00a0keep the profile of the bill high. \u00a0Procedurally, the bill will be\u00a0referred to Committee for further consideration; in the Senate, it will go\u00a0to the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and in the\u00a0House, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will receive the\u00a0bill. \u00a0As with any legislation, FRPAA faces an uphill battle in an\u00a0election year, but given the growing attention this issue has received in\u00a0the past year (from the White House Office of Science and Technology\u00a0Policy, to the America COMPETES Act, to the recent Research Works Act),\u00a0we\u2019re hopeful that the bill can continue to advance. \n I think the biggest threat is inaction, so vocal support from stakeholders\u00a0will be crucial! \n Q: What can people do to help FRPAA become law? \n The most important thing that people \u2013 especially active scientists \u2013 can\u00a0do help advance this bill is to speak out in support of this bill. \u00a0And we\u00a0need folks to speak out in two ways: \n First, speak out to your members of Congress. The ATA has an Action\u00a0Center set up so that you can simply log on, pick your Senators and\u00a0Representatives, and automatically generate a letter asking them to\u00a0support FRPAA. \u00a0The Action Center has all kinds of information about the\u00a0bill, including Talking Points, FAQ\u2019a and even template letters, to help\u00a0make the process as easy as possible. Check\u00a0it out! \n Second, speak out to your colleagues and your community. \u00a0Blog about the\u00a0bill, or spread the word on Twitter. \u00a0Consider writing an OpEd for your\u00a0local newspaper, or writing an article for your organization\u2019s newsletter.\u00a0The more people become aware of this issue, the more they support it.\u00a0Help us spread the word! \n Q: Finally, how can people follow what the ATA is doing, and\u00a0keep up with your calls for action? \n You can sign onto the Alliance for Taxpayer Access by going to our\u00a0website . There\u2019s no charge. \n If you simply want to be added to our email list for alerts and updates,\u00a0contact either or myself (heather@arl.org) \u00a0or Andrea Higginbotham\u00a0(andrea@arl.org), or follow us on Twitter at @SPARC_NA ."], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/michaelnielsen/wmna/~3/UuriktzEedc/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://community.parentprojectmd.org/": 1, "https://twitter.com/": 2, "http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/": 7, "http://www.geneticalliance.org/": 1, "http://publicaccess.nih.gov/": 1, "http://www.arl.org/": 3, "http://www.geneticalliance.org": 1, "http://www.parentprojectmd.org/": 1, "http://www.arl.org": 1, "http://cyber.harvard.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Michael Nielsen"}, {"content": ["Elsevier is the world\u2019s largest and most profitable scientific publisher, making a profit of 1.1 billion dollars on revenue of 3.2 billion dollars in 2009 .

Suppose it\u2019s announced in the next few years that the LHC has discovered the Higgs boson. There will, no doubt, be a peer-reviewed scientific paper describing the result. \n How should we regard such an announcement? \n The chain of evidence behind the result will no doubt be phenomenally complex. The LHC analyses about 600 million particle collisions per second . The data analysis is done using a cluster of more than 200,000 processing cores , and tens of millions of lines of software code. That code is built on all sorts of extremely specialized knowledge and assumptions about detector and beam physics, statistical inference, quantum field theory, and so on. Whatsmore that code, like any large software package, no doubt has many bugs, despite enormous effort to eliminate bugs . \n No one person in the world will understand in detail the entire chain of evidence that led to the discovery of the Higgs. In fact, it\u2019s possible that very few (no?) people will understand in much depth even just the principles behind the chain of evidence. How many people have truly mastered quantum field theory, statistical inference, detector physics, and distributed computing? \n What, then, should we make of any paper announcing that the Higgs boson has been found? \n Standard pre-publication peer review will mean little. Yes, it\u2019ll be useful as an independent sanity check of the work. But all it will show is that there\u2019s no glaringly obvious holes. It certainly won\u2019t involve more than a cursory inspection of the evidence. \n A related situation arose in the 1980s in mathematics. It was announced in the early 1980s that an extremely important mathematical problem had been solved: the classification of the finite simple groups . The proof had taken about 30 years, and involved an effort by 100 or so mathematicians, spread across many papers and thousands of pages of proof. \n Unfortunately, the original proof had gaps. Most of them were not serious. But at least one serious gap remained . In 2004, two mathematicians published a two-volume, 1,200 page supplement to the original proof, filling in the gap. (At least, we hope they\u2019ve filled in the gap!) \n When discoveries rely on hundreds of pieces of evidence or steps of reasoning, we can be pretty sure of our conclusions, provided our error rate is low, say one part in a hundred thousand. But when we start to use a million or a billion (or a trillion or more) pieces of evidence or steps of reasoning, an error rate of one part in a million \nbecomes a guarantee of failure, unless we develop systems that can tolerate those errors. \n It seems to me that one of the core questions the scientific community will wrestle with over the next few decades is what principles and practices we use to judge whether or not a conclusion drawn from a large body of networked knowledge is correct? To put it another way, how can we ensure that we reliably come to correct conclusions, despite the fact that some of our evidence or reasoning is almost certainly wrong? \n At the moment each large-scale collaboration addresses this in their own way. The people at the LHC and those responsible for the classification of finite simple groups are certainly very smart, and I\u2019ve no doubt they\u2019re doing lots of smart things to eliminate or greatly reduce the impact of errors. But it\u2019d be good to have a principled way of understanding how and when we can come to correct scientific conclusions, in the face of low-level errors in the evidence and reasoning used to arrive at those errors. \n If you doubt there\u2019s a problem here, then think about the mistakes that led to the Pentium floating point bug . Or think of the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter . That\u2019s often described as a failure to convert between metric and imperial units, which makes it sound trivial, like the people at NASA are fools. The real problem was deeper. As a NASA official said : \n People sometimes make errors. The problem here was not the error [of unit conversion], it was the failure of NASA\u2019s systems engineering, and the checks and balances in our processes to detect the error. That\u2019s why we lost the spacecraft. \n In other words, when you\u2019re working at NASA scale, problems that are unlikely at small scale, like failing to do a unit conversion, are certain to occur. It\u2019s foolish to act as though they won\u2019t happen. Instead, you need to develop systems which limit the impact of such errors. \n In the context of science, what this means is that we need new methods of fault-tolerant discovery. \n I don\u2019t have well-developed answers to the questions I\u2019ve raised above, riffing off David Weinberger\u2019s original question. But I will finish with the notion that one useful source of ideas may be systems and safety engineering , which are responsible for the reliable performance of complex systems such as modern aircraft. According to Boeing , a 747-400 has six million parts, and the first 747 required 75,000 engineering drawings. Not to mention all the fallible human \u201ccomponents\u201d in a modern aircraft. Yet aircraft systems and safety engineers have developed checks and balances that let us draw with very high probability the conclusion \u201cThe plane will get safely from point A to B\u201d. Sounds like a promising source of insights to me! \n Further reading: An intriguing experiment in distributed verification of a mathematical proof has been done in an article by Doron Zeilberger . Even if you can\u2019t follow the mathematics, it\u2019s stimulating to look through. I\u2019ve taken a stab at some of the issues in this post before, in my essay Science beyond individual understanding . I\u2019m also looking forward to David Weinberger\u2019s new book about networked knowledge, Too Big To Know .

It seems like it might have broader interest, so I\u2019m reposting it here. Original link here . \n The topic of open access to scientific papers comes up often on Hacker News. \n Unfortunately, those discussions sometimes bog down in misinformation and misunderstandings. \n Although it\u2019s not exactly my area of expertise, it\u2019s close \u2014 I\u2019ve spent the last three years working on open science. \n So I thought it might be useful to post a summary of the current state of open access. There\u2019s a lot going on, so even though this essay appears lengthy, it\u2019s actually a very brief and incomplete summary of what\u2019s happening. I have links to further reading at the end. \n This is not a small stakes game. The big scientific publishers are phenomenally profitable. In 2009, Elsevier made a profit of 1.1 billion dollars on revenue of 3.2 billion dollars . That\u2019s a margin (and business model) they are very strongly motivated to protect. They\u2019re the biggest commercial journal publisher, but the other big publishers are also extremely profitable. \n Even not-for-profit societies often make an enormous profit on their journals. In 2004 (the most recent year for which I have figures) the American Chemical Society made a profit of 40 million dollars on revenues of 340 million dollars . Not bad! This money is reinvested in other society activities, including salaries. Top execs receive salaries in the 500k to 1m range (as of 2006 , I\u2019m sure it\u2019s quite a bit higher now.) \n The traditional publishers make money by charging journal subscription fees to libraries. Why they make so much money is a matter for much discussion, but I will merely point out one fact: there are big systematic inefficiencies built into the market. University libraries for the most part pay the subscription fees, but they rely on guidance (and often respond to pressure) from faculty members in deciding what journals to subscribe to. In practice, faculty often have a lot of power in making these decisions, without bearing the costs. And so they can be quite price-insensitive. \n The journal publishers have wildly varying (and changing) responses to the notion of open access. \n For example, most Springer journals are closed access, but in 2008 Springer bought BioMedCentral , one of the original open access publishers, and by some counts the world\u2019s largest. They continue to operate. (More on the deal here .) \n [Update: It has been pointed out to me in email that Springer now uses a hybrid open access model for most of their journals, whereby authors can opt to pay a fee to make their articles open access. If the authors don't pay that fee, the articles remain closed. The other Springer journals, including BioMedCentral, are fully open access.] \n Nature Publishing Group is also mostly closed access, but has recently started an open access journal called Scientific Reports , apparently modeled after the (open access) Public Library of Science\u2019s journal PLoS One . \n It is sometimes stated that big commercial publishers don\u2019t allow authors to put free-to-access copies of their papers on the web. In fact, policies vary quite a bit from publisher to publisher. Elsevier and Springer , for example, do allow authors to put copies of their papers on their websites, and into institutional repositories. This doesn\u2019t mean that always (or even often) happens, but it\u2019s at least in principle possible. \n Comments on HN sometimes assume that open access is somehow a new issue, or an issue that no-one has been doing anything about until recently. \n This is far from the case. Take a look at the Open Access Newsletters and you\u2019ll realize that there\u2019s a community of people working very, very hard for open access. They\u2019re just not necessarily working in ways that are visible to hackers. \n Nonetheless, as a result of the efforts of people in the open access movement, a lot of successes have been achieved, and there is a great deal of momentum toward open access. \n Here\u2019s a few examples of success: \n In 2008 the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014 by far the world\u2019s largest funding agency, with a $30+ billion dollar a year budget \u2014 adopted a policy requiring that all NIH-funded research be made openly accessible within 12 months of publication. See here for more . \n All 7 UK Research Councils have adopted similar open access policies requiring researchers they fund to make their work openly accessible. \n Many universities have adopted open access policies. Examples include: Harvard\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences , MIT , and Princeton . \n As a result of policies like these, in years to come you should see more and more freely downloadable papers showing up in search results. \n Note that there are a lot of differences of detail in the different policies, and those details can make a big difference to the practical impact of the policies. I won\u2019t try to summarize all the nuances here, I\u2019m merely pointing out that there is a lot of institutional movement. \n Many more pointers to open access policies may be found at ROARMAP . That site notes 52 open access policies from grant agencies, and 135 from academic institutions. \n There\u2019s obviously still a long way to go before there is universal open access to publicly-funded research, but there has been a lot of progress, and a lot of momentum. \n One thing that I hope will happen is that the US Federal Research Public Access Act passes. First proposed in 2006 (and again in 2010), this Act would essentially extend the NIH policy to all US Government-funded research (from agencies with budgets over 100 million). My understanding is that at present the Act is tied up in committee. \n Despite (or because of) this progress, there is considerable pushback on the open access movement from some scientific publishers. As just one instance, in 2007 some large publishers hired a very aggressive PR firm to wage a campaign to publicly discredit open access. \n I will not be surprised if this pushback escalates. \n What can hackers do to help out? \n One great thing to do is start a startup in this space. Startups (and former startups) like Mendeley , ChemSpider , BioMedCentral , PLoS and others have had a big impact over the past ten or so years, but there\u2019s even bigger opportunities for hackers to really redefine scientific publishing. Ideas like text mining, recommender systems, open access to data, automated inference, and many others can be pushed much, much further. \n I\u2019ve written about this in the following essay: Is Scientific Publishing About to be Disrupted? Many of those ideas are developed in much greater depth in my book on open science, Reinventing Discovery . \n For less technical (and less time-consuming!) ways of getting involved, you may want to subscribe to the RSS feed at the Alliance for Taxpayer Access . This organization was crucial in helping get the NIH open access policy passed, and they\u2019re helping do the same for the Federal Public Research Access Act, as well as other open access efforts. \n If you want to know more, the best single resource I know is Peter Suber\u2019s website . \n Suber has, for example, written an extremely informative introduction to open access . His still-active Open Access Newsletter is a goldmine of information, as is his (no longer active) blog . He also runs the open access tracking project . \n If you got this far, thanks for reading!

In the book I make the case that networked science has the potential to dramatically speed up the rate of scientific discovery, not just in one field, but across all of science. Furthermore, it won\u2019t just speed up discovery, but will actually amplify our collective intelligence, expanding the range of scientific problems which can be attacked at all. \n But, as I explain in the book, there are cultural obstacles that are blocking networked science from achieving its full potential. And so the book is also a manifesto, arguing that networked science must be open science if it is to realize its potential. \n Making the change to open science is a big challenge. In my opinion it\u2019s one of the biggest challenges our society faces, one that requires action on many fronts. One of those fronts is to make sure that everyone \u2014 including scientists, but also grant agencies, governments, libraries, and, especially, the general public -\u2013 understands how important the stakes are, and how urgent is the need for change. And so my big hope for this book is that it will help raise the profile of open science. I want open science to become a part of our general culture, a subject every educated layperson is familiar with, and has an opinion about. If we can cause that to happen, then I believe that a big and positive shift in the culture of science is inevitable. And that will benefit everyone. \n The book is shipping in hardcover from Amazon.com, and should ship through other booksellers by October 21. Note that the Kindle edition isn\u2019t out as I write, but should arrive by October 21. A few relevant links: \n \n Hardcover at Amazon.com (available now)\n Kindle at Amazon.com (can pre-order now, ships by Oct 21)\n Hardcover at Amazon.co.uk (can pre-order now, ships by Oct 21)\n Hardcover at Amazon.ca (can pre-order now, ships by Oct 21)\n \n Two caveats. First, I\u2019m occasionally asked if the book is being released under a Creative Commons license. I discussed this option at length with my publisher, who ultimately declined. A couple of people have said to me that they find this ironic. This isn\u2019t so, since the book argues as a broad principle that publicly funded science should be open science; the book is neither publicly funded nor, strictly speaking, science. However, as a personal preference I\u2019d still like to see it enter the commons sooner rather than later. After the paperback has been out for a while, I will approach my publisher again to see what can be done. \n Second, the book is not meant to be a reference work on open science. Instead, I\u2019ve highlighted a small set of focused examples, inevitably leaving many great open science projects out. I hope the people running those other projects can forgive me. My aim wasn\u2019t to write a reference work, but rather to write the kind of book that people will enjoy reading, and which enthusiasts of open science can give to their friends and family to help explain what open science is all about, and why it matters so very much. \n Let me conclude by quoting one of my favorite lines from Tolkien: \u201cThe praise of the praiseworthy is above all reward\u201d. And so it gives me great delight to finish with quotes from a few of the endorsements and reviews the book has received: \n Science has always been a contact sport; the interaction of many minds is the engine of the discipline. Michael Nielsen has given us an unparalleled account of how new tools for collaboration are transforming scientific practice. Reinventing Discovery doesn\u2019t just help us understand how the sciences are changing, it shows us how we can participate in the change. - Clay Shirky \n This is the book on how networks will drive a revolution in scientific discovery; definitely recommended. - Tyler Cowen \n Anyone who has followed science in recent years has noticed something odd: science is less and less about a solitary scientist working alone in a lab. Scientists are working in networks, and those networks are gaining scope, speed, and power through the internet. Nonscientists have been getting in on the act, too, folding proteins and identifying galaxies. Michael Nielsen has been watching these developments too, but he\u2019s done much more: he\u2019s provided the best synthesis I\u2019ve seen of this new kind of science, and he\u2019s also thought deeply about what it means for the future of how we understand the world. Reinventing Discovery is a delightfully written, thought-provoking book. - Carl Zimmer \n \n Reinventing Discovery will frame serious discussion and inspire wild, disruptive ideas for the next decade. - Chris Lintott in Nature \n \n Nielsen has created perhaps the most compelling and comprehensive case so far for a new approach to science in the Internet age. - Timo Hannay in Nature Physics"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/michaelnielsen/wmna/~3/GpRYuUOqisY/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://michaelnielsen.org/blog": 1, "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/": 1, "http://www.shirky.com/": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 2, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://www.amazon.ca/": 1, "http://twitter.com/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 2, "http://www.co.uk/": 1, "http://marginalrevolution.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Michael Nielsen"}, {"content": ["I\u2019ll be speaking about open science at events at Georgia Tech, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina over the next few days.
