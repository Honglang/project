In honor of this spooky Halloween I found a nifty little infographic on the Ghost Owl, better known as the Snowy Owl in the States (and Hedwig for those attending Hogwarts). So apparently this owl is totally boss. Snowy owls have these things called Facial Discs (stiff feathers around their eyes) to direct sound waves toward their ears. These ears, in fact, are asymmetrically located on their head to help these owls pinpoint their prey more accurately. Speaking of prey, THESE OWLS CAN NOM \u2014 eating almost 1,600 lemmings a year! That\u2019s 3-5 of those cute, dumb little rodents a day! \n The rest of the infographic contains a lot of cool information and facts about this bitchin\u2019 bird. Like the fact that it\u2019s been it\u2019s own genus for years. BOSS. But recent genetic research shows that they are related to horned owls. Bummer, but you still rock Hedwig! Also I didn\u2019t know this but it totally makes sense \u2014 owls in general can\u2019t move their (human-sized) eyeballs on their own. They have to move their flexible neck to look around! I guess that\u2019s why owls are so chill, no shifty eyes; or from another perspective, mad freaky. But if this bird gives you the heebie jeebies, don\u2019t fret, for this bird resides in the far north near the arctic circle. No trick or treating for this fowl. HAPPY SPOOKING.

Many celebrated last weekend with halloween parties, trips to the bars and lots of fun, but the real holiday is tomorrow! Are you planning to dress up? Halloween might be one of my favorites, but I only ever dress up as a cat, ballerina or french girl (only once). \n Families spend an average of $150 on Halloween preparations. This includes costumes, fake blood, and pumpkins! One way to cut down on costs is to think up costumes that use your regular clothes. Lucky for you all, I have three A+ (in my opinion) costumes that may be sitting in your closet or only require a few quick purchases! \n My personal favorite, the cat. Grab a cheap pair of kitty ears, draw some whiskers in black eyeliner, throw on a black top and black jeans and step into your favorite black stilettos. \n The ballerina. Buy or make a tutu- tule is really easy to work with and extremely inexpensive \u2013 wear a black tank top or leotard and some tights. Oh and twirl all night long. \n The French girl. A striped shirt, a drawn on mustache and a berret. Voila! \n Have a happy and safe Halloween!

Even with all of these achievements, however, we all have still have something in common to keep us grounded: illness. \n With our global population growing ever larger year after year we now have more potential than ever before to grow and learn as people, but it also means that more and more treatments for illnesses and sickness are necessary, and it\u2019s not cheap. Today\u2019s infographic explores the amount spent (and projected to be spent) on healthcare from five first-world nations and what exactly it\u2019s being spent on. \n For instance, the most money being spent on healthcare in the U.K. at the moment tends to be focused on research and development (hundreds of millions of dollars spent on stem cell and neurodegeneration research) whereas the U.S. healthcare system invests more in immunizations and HIV/AIDS treatment and research. \n For more information on the healthcare spending habits of some of the world\u2019s leading nations, refer to the infographic below.

Seriously. If you don\u2019t know what an equity release is, this infogrpahic will show you the way to being more connected with our senior citizens, as this is a life decision many of them are arriving at. \n It\u2019s a really great option for numerous folks who are aging and don\u2019t plan on needing extra dough to leave behind. So for a lot of the elderly population, which is constantly growing by the way, getting an equity release makes sense in order to make their \u201cgolden years\u201d even more golden. Although this infographic focuses on the plans and fees offered in the U.K., equity releases are growing in popularity in the U.S. as well. \n But not everyone owns a house, you say. This is true and a fact that reflects the prejudices and harsh realities of our society. But, with more education and the growing importance of owning homes in terms of what it means for one\u2019s family, hopefully more and more will have the opportunity to make this choice in the future.

I know you\u2019re delicious, I know you\u2019re convenient, but sometimes I like my air conditioning. \n Mobile eateries started popping up in my hometown, Austin, five or six years ago. Since then there has been an explosion and we now boast almost 1300 of them . Yeah, holly crap. Even in my current city of San marcos, with a population of barely 50,000, we have TWO food trailer parks. Probably over 30 vendors in the city as well. Food trucks seem like they have over-saturated the market, but are they here to stay? \n I believe a lot of them will move to brick-and-mortar locations once a big following has been garnered. If other trucks take their place, I do not know. Also, as the economy picks up, many of these empty parking lots and eateries are going to be sold to developers. In my opinion a good economy is not good for our mobile snack shacks.

Everyone at my campus knows someone who is prescribed adderall or vyvanse and can acquire the drug within a very short amount of time for a very competitive price. After studying this infographic I was not surprised to see that most brain-hacking drug users remain in the education industry. Scientists, professors and researchers use these drugs to have an edge above their competitors or to keep up with the work load. \n One of the more concerning aspects of the today\u2019s graphic is that middle-schoolers are using the prescription drugs more and more. 5.2% of eight graders have used a mentally performance enhancing drug. When I was in eighth grade I though I was a badass for saying \u2018shit\u2019 in school. Now they are using adderall or other prescription stimulants? These drugs are not made for humans that young. These young adults do not know the right dosage or time-of-day to take these drugs and could cause addiction or other health problems that could create very serious problems in a very early stage of life. \n Abuse of these mind hacking drugs is one of the fastest growing problems of our generation. As long as doctors keep prescribing these harmful drugs to too many youngsters the problem will continue to grow. Although some children really do need these drugs to function regularly, my personal opinion is that the requirements and potency of these drugs should wait until the patient is of age \u2013 the same as tobacco or alcohol. The availability of these drugs to young Americans needs to diminish if the trend of usage wants to decrease.

This is probably because I had a conversation with a super ripped body builder and she kept emphasizing how she consumes absolutely NO sugar. Like, even good, natural kind in fruits.

I mean, I know it\u2019s in everything delicious, but usually delicious things are bad for you, especially things with high fructose corn syrup in it\u2026 \n Sure enough, if I had any doubt about high fructose corn syrup, today\u2019s infographic reinforced that doubt.

Jumping from a height higher than anyone previously had ever tried (the last record was held by Joseph Kittinger in 1960 from a height of 102,800 feet) Felix has surpassed any and all attempts of free falling. From 128,000 feet, Felix plunged toward the Earth like a human meteor with little else but four-layer pressure suit, a balloon to get him up there and balls of steel. After merely 40 seconds of free fall, Felix broke the sound barrier (a first ever, in terms of free-falling) and continues down for another 5.5 minutes, risking the possibility of going into a harmful or otherwise fatal spin that would knock him unconscious. Luckily he managed to fall with grace. \n The first infographic represents statistics and information about Felix and his jump. The second, and probably the more illuminating of the two, shows some perspective of just how high in the sky he was. In comparison to the tallest building in the world, Godzilla, Mount Everest, and Mars\u2019 largest mountain, the altitude at which Felix fell far surpasses those heights to say the least. In the end, it\u2019s incredible to think that just over a century ago we couldn\u2019t even figure out how to fly planes but now we have the ability to parachute from the Stratosphere. Huh.
