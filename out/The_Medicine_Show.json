Newer drugs like Valium, Halcion and the bestseller Ambien are all just improvements on this ancient mechanism. \n Now John Renger, a sleep researcher at Merck, thinks his team has created the first new way in millennia to help people get their z\u2019s . \n Merck has done studies in almost 3,000 patients comparing Renger\u2019s pill, suvorexant, with a placebo. The drug helps patients get to sleep perhaps 10 minutes faster and stay asleep 20 minutes longer\u2013not that far out of line with existing therapies and not that much of a marketing advantage. \n But there are tantalizing signs as the FDA prepares to review suvorexant that this drug may be fundamentally different from current sleeping pills like Ambien, Lunesta and Sonata, lacking their rare but troubling side effects, like memory loss and sleepwalking. \n \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here is really turn the medical approach to insomnia on its head,\u201d says Renger, \u201cbecause for the first time in our history we are beginning to understand how the brain controls sleep and waking. Showing that blocking wakefulness allows patients to go to sleep more quickly and to sleep throughout the night, it\u2019s really a sea change.\u201d Renger\u2019s boss, Merck Senior Vice President Darryle Schoepp, calls this \u201csome of the most exciting science I\u2019ve ever been involved in.\u201d \n But if this seems like a clear big pharma success story\u2013creating a breakthrough pill in one of the most-prescribed categories ever\u2013think again. Analysts doubt suvorexant can make a dent now that Ambien, which was prescribed 40 million times last year, is a cheap generic that costs under $2 per pill, 21% of the price of branded sleep drugs. Mark Schoenebaum at ISI Group, a fan of Merck shares, forecasts suvorexant sales of just $350 million in 2016, only 0.8% of Merck\u2019s sales that year. \n That\u2019s why the rest of the drug industry should pay close attention to suvorexant. What happens if new medicines for common ailments like insomnia can\u2019t succeed in a world where 78% of drug sales by volume are for cheap generics and where health insurers and government plans alike are increasingly worried about costs? \n Most of Merck\u2019s rivals have voted already, moving toward premium-priced areas like cancer and autoimmune disease. Merck is continuing not only in insomnia but also heart disease and diabetes. \n The sleeping pill market is particularly ripe for innovation. When Ambien was launched in 1992, Time was running a story, \u201cThe Dark Side of Halcion,\u201d which raised a slew of questions about whether the sleeping pill was addictive and dangerous. When the Drug Enforcement Agency classified Ambien as less addictive than Halcion, sales hit $1.8 billion by 2005 before the patent expired. \n Now it\u2019s Ambien\u2019s turn. In 2001 Peter Buck, the guitarist of the socially responsible jangle-pop band R.E.M., went crazy on a British Airlines flight and nearly went to jail; he was saved partly by on-the-stand character testimony from U2\u2032s Bono and by the defense that Ambien had caused his behavior. In 2006 Patrick Kennedy, driving on Ambien, had a terrible car crash that made headlines. Shortly thereafter the FDA added warnings to Ambien\u2019s label saying that the drug did indeed make people go for drives without remembering what they had been doing\u2013they also might scarf ice cream or have sex without remembering it. \n Doctors and regulators say these effects are rare, but the reports keep coming. A story this September in Marie Claire documented cases where sleep-driving on Ambien resulted in DUI arrests\u2013or in drivers escaping vehicular manslaughter charges because they had taken the drug. \n Why might suvorexant be better? All the older drugs turn on brain switches called GABA receptors, present in half of the 1 billion neurons in the brain, causing whole-head drowsiness. Instead, suvorexant turns off a different set of switches, known as orexin receptors, which are involved in waking people up and are only present in 70,000 neurons in a particular place in the brain. \n These orexin cells were discovered from the study of narcolepsy, a disease in which people cannot stay awake, in the late 1990s by Emmanuel Mignot, a Stanford researcher, who found that dogs with a defective orexin receptor gene developed the condition. In humans narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder that destroys the orexin neurons. Merck is one of a handful of drug companies to try to turn this insight into a sleep drug\u2013and maybe the first to succeed. \n Suvorexant does have critics. Daniel F. Kripke, a doctor at Scripps Research Institute who has long argued existing sleep drugs are harmful, isn\u2019t a fan. He points out that of 521 patients who took the drug in a safety study, 2 had forms of sleep paralysis, which can be a symptom of narcolepsy. Merck says the real severe paralysis that occurs with the disease has not occurred in its trials. \n Mignot says he is \u201cnot as worried\u201d as Kripke: \u201cIt is always good for patients to have a new drug that works completely differently.\u201d \n Steven Feinsilver at Mount Sinai School of Medicine agrees: \u201cWe need some new sleeping pills.\u201d \n But science is one thing and commerce another. In an age where cost containment is the dominant issue in medicine, better drugs\u2013even much better drugs\u2013just may not be as profitable as they used to be. \n \u201cIt\u2019s a theoretically huge market,\u201d Schoenebaum says. \u201cThat said, competition will be generic, basically free drugs, and insurance companies will likely make life as difficult as possible for Merck.\u201d \n Deep into Sleep \n \nThe $1.6 billion annual U.S. market for insomnia drugs is largely served by generics that all work on the brain in the same way. \n \n Ambien \nAnnual prescriptions: 40 million \nPrescribed four times more often than closest competitor. \n Temazepam/ Restoril \nAnnual prescriptions: 8.5 million \nApproved in 1981, and originally marketed by Sandoz, now part of Novartis. \n Ambien CR \nAnnual prescriptions: 4.7 million \nSustained release Ambien, including generic versions. \n Lunesta \nAnnual prescriptions: 4.3 million \nThe only successful nongeneric sleep drug on the market. \n Triazolam /Halcion \nAnnual prescriptions: 1.2 million \nOnce the biggest sleep drug in the country, now rarely used. \n Rozerem \nAnnual prescriptions: 379,000 \nNew type of sleep drug foundered when found to be ineffective."], "link": "http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/10/31/can-merck-wake-the-sleeping-pill-market-it-depends-on-ambiens-side-effects/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/": 1, "http://www.marieclaire.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Medicine Show"}, {"content": ["Yesterday, I had the chance to sit down with Christopher Viehbacher, who has been the chief executive of Sanofi , the fourth-largest drug company in the world, since 2008.

It\u2019s the kind of result that can give anyone who follows medical news whiplash. Just a year ago, a study in women showed that certain vitamins not only don\u2019t help but can increase the rate of death. What gives? \n Studies of vitamins over the past decade have been \u201cquite variable,\u201d says Raymond DuBois, a professor of cancer medicine at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and a former president of the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR). In context, that 8% decrease in risk over such a long period of time is not that large, though obviously better than nothing. Getting people to exercise regularly, avoid cigarettes, sun exposure, and other known carcinogens would have a much bigger and immediate impact in reducing cancer cases. Half of cancer cases are thought to be preventable by avoiding known risks, he argues. \n \u201cThis is a case of a statistically significant but not particularly impactful result,\u201d notes George Sledge, an oncologist at Indiana University and a past-president of the American Society for Clinical Oncology. \u201cThe reduction in cancer incidence is small but real, but at the end of the day no one lived any longer.\u201d \n The new study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and presented at a medical conference held by the AACR, has several big advantages over previous trials, and is the best-conducted study of multivitamin use conducted to date. It is a randomized controlled study, meaning that similar patients were assigned at random to either get either Centrum or placebo. This is the gold standard for medical research, because it means that whether or not they got the multivitamin was the only difference between the drug and placebo groups. \n \u201cIt\u2019s a trial that shows how we can and should obtain evidence about what to eat and what not to eat and which supplements to take,\u201d says Christian Gluud, head of the Copenhagen Trials Unit at the Copenhagen University\u00a0Hospital. But though he has nothing but praise for the way the study was conducted and reported, he notes that this statistical significance is only borderline. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there was a benefit, but it could be anything from a 14% decrease in risk to an 0.002% decrease in risk of cancer. Any trial should be seen as just a piece of evidence and therefore I would say we need further randomized trials of similar size and similar duration of follow-up before anyone should take therapeutic action on these results,\u201d he says. \n Jaakko Mursu, the epidemilogist at the University of Eastern Finland who was lead author on the study showing vitamins could even be a little bit harmful, says the new result doesn\u2019t change his overall take on the totality of the data. \u201cMy opinion is that there is no clear evidence for either benefits or harmful effects,\u201d he writes via email. \n For every 100 people who took the vitamins for 10 years, Mursu says, taking Centrum would reduce the number of cancers from 18.3 to 17; put differently, Murku says, you\u2019d have to treat 83 people for 11 years to avoid one cancer case. As Sledge and Dubois both noted, that is a very small impact on the number of cancers, and taken with all the other research that has been done it\u2019s difficult to make a clear recommendation about what patients should do. \n Dubois would like to see studies that focus specifically on patients who have some vitamin deficiencies \u2014 and to figure out exactly which subset of patients are getting the benefit. But at the end of the day the decision to take a vitamin is probably a personal choice. There is unlikely to be great benefit or great harm in doing it. At the end of the day, people take these pills as much because they like to, because it gives them some measure of control over their health. (I\u2019m not sure I believe in the mental benefits of taking fish oil, but I\u2019m taking it every day because I think it improves my mood; if that\u2019s a placebo effect, I\u2019ll take it.) \n This study is good news for Pfizer , which makes Centrum. Recent studies have piled on negative results that there aren\u2019t benefits for taking a multi-vitamin; even if this study doesn\u2019t change the scientific consensus, it does change the public narrative about vitamins. You might not think that would matter much to Pfizer, which is gigantic. But sales of Centrum are probably in the high hundreds of millions per year, and this will help them stay there or grow. Because vitamins aren\u2019t protected by patents, this is a steady, and valuable, revenue stream for the company. \n Updated from original post with additional reporting. \n Related on Forbes: \n see photos  Click for full photo gallery: 10 'Healthy' Habits That Drain Your Bank Account"], "link": "http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/10/17/studies-on-vitamins-likely-to-give-patients-whiplash/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.forbes.com/": 4, "http://jama.jamanetwork.com/": 1, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Medicine Show"}, {"content": ["During the debate, I and several other Forbes writers were providing coverage on Twitter.

One thing we talked about was Avik\u2019s recent column arguing that Romney\u2019s plan is better than Obamacare for those with pre-existing conditions . He doesn\u2019t speak for the Romney campaign. \n One thing I wish I\u2019d noted: that Politifact rated Romney\u2019s debate claim that his plan would cover people with pre-existing conditions \u201cmostly false .\u201d What Romney plans, as Avik describes, is to strengthen the protections of the 1996 HIPAA law to help make sure people who are continuously insured or who lose their insurance for a short time. \n The guts of Politifact\u2019s ruling are here: \n Romney said his health care proposals include protections for pre-existing conditions. What he didn\u2019t say at the debate \u2014 but which his website states and advisers confirmed after the debate \u2014 is that people would be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured. \n The health care law, though, offers protections whether people have current coverage or not, so it offers more robust protection. The law also includes a requirement that everyone have insurance or pay a tax penalty. Romney\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t have that requirement. \n I think I understand Avik\u2019s fundamental argument: it\u2019s that, in the long-term, it would be better if insurance were no longer linked to employment. This, a result of laws about wages in World-War-II-era America, is one of the original sins of the U.S. health care system. He feels that fixing this problem would make the insurance market more of a free one, and that market forces would fix things for the insured. By contrast, simply expanding coverage could be bad for those people by making the whole system even more insolvent. \n But I don\u2019t think this is what any average person means by \u201cbetter for those with pre-existing conditions.\u201d What people mean when they say \u201cbetter for people with pre-existing conditions\u201d is that people with pre-existing conditions will face fewer or no obstacles to coverage. Graded on that point alone, and not on the broader context of what this means for health care, it\u2019s pretty clear that ObamaCare is better. \n I agree with Avik that the tax rules that led to health insurance being linked to employers is one of the original sins of the U.S. health care system; the other would be the decision to pay for just about everything on a fee for service basis, which means more care is more profitable even if it is not better. But I think it\u2019s an open question whether fixing those problems will immediately lead the system we have to self-correct. \n Really, I think the basic positions of both campaigns are fairly clear. The Obama administration wants to control costs, but thinks that in order to do that it\u2019s necessary to get more healthy people into the system. The Romney campaign wants to get more people access to health care, but believes in order to do that one must fix the problems that are leading costs to go out of control. Basically, I think the differences are summed up effectively by this graph from the Journal of the American Medical Association . As you can see, the projections on cost are not that much different on Medicare, and show a big difference on Medicaid. Only Obam\u2019s plan increases spending on new private insurance. I think this is a pretty fair summary of the basic positions of both campaigns: One is about access first, and tries to use that power to lower costs later; \u00a0the other is about making sure costs are controlled, in the hopes that lower costs will make it possible to expand access later."], "link": "http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/10/16/no-romneycare-is-not-better-for-people-with-pre-existing-conditions/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/": 1, "http://www.forbes.com/": 1, "http://jama.jamanetwork.com/": 1, "http://www.politifact.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Medicine Show"}, {"content": ["Biogen CEO George Scangos \n For the past few months, I\u2019ve been working on a big project with a team of some of the smartest people at Forbes \u2013 our first-ever health care conference, hosted by Steve Forbes himself. It will be held here in New York City on the evening of December 4 and all day on December 5. Click here for the conference website . \n The theme of the day will be how unshackling market forces can help us face up to some of the biggest problems facing our society: not only ballooning health care costs but also the epidemics of Alzheimer\u2019s, obesity, and diabetes that help drive them. These challenges are among the greatest opportunities available to entrepreneurs, and innovators, and they require smart, mindful regulation. Some of the top minds in health care will talk about how to fix current health care institutions with greater transparency and accountability. Others will introduce the new, disruptive technologies that are likely to be part of any future solution. And that effort will get disparate voices into the same room. Here\u2019s a sampling of what to expect. \n  J&J's Paul Stoffels \n Can An Entrepreneurial Spirit Transform Drug Discovery? Inventing new medicines has never been harder. Already, all major pharmaceutical companies are spending billions of dollars in research and development for every drug they manage to get to market, and the discovery effort is only getting more expensive. The cost of inventing a new drug is doubling every nine years, an exponential increase that one analyst has called \u201cEroom\u2019s Law\u201d for the way it turns Moore\u2019s Law, the driver of the computer industry\u2019s productivity, on its head. How do we get pharma\u2019s innovation engine humming again? We\u2019ll ask some of the top executives in drug R&D, starting with two who have helped run both hungry startups and established giants: George Scangos, who founded and for 14 years ran the small biotech firm Exelixis before taking the reins at Biogen Idec, one of the first and biggest biotechnology companies, as it emerged, resurgent, from several years of doldrums; and Paul Stoffels, who helped create the antiretroviral cocktails that made HIV a chronic disease, founded an HIV drug startup called Tibotec, and now serves as Chief Scientific Officer for Johnson & Johnson, one of the largest medical research enterprises in the entire world. \n  Former Aetna CEO Ron Williams \n Making Health Insurance Price Transparent. What if health care were a consumer product? When a car is sold, the customer and the dealer are both aware of the price. Why can\u2019t the same bargaining process occur between health insurers and their customers? This question bothers Steve Forbes, and he will lead a discussion of how transparency can lead to affordability and accessibility. Among his panelists: Ron Williams, the former chairman and chief executive of Aetna; Simon Stevens, the President of Global Health at United Health Group; and John Driscoll, the chief executive of Castlight Heath, a company whose entire business plan relies on X-raying doctor\u2019s bills so the rest of us can understand them. \n  Jonathan Rothberg \n - DNA Sequencing \u2014 A Disruptive Force Seeks Its Purpose . The cost of DNA sequencing has been dropping faster than the number of transistors you can put on a microchip. That kind of velocity can transform entire industries. And now, as the cost of a human genome drops below $2,000, we\u2019re starting to see this technology used not just in research but in real medicine, diagnosing rare genetic diseases, targeting cancer drugs, and perhaps even helping us to figure out why infants are in the neonatal intensive care unit. What\u2019s next? Some of the greatest minds in the field will tell us, including Jonathan Rothberg, the chief executive of Life Technologies\u2019 Ion Torrent division, who has twice kick-started new arms races in the DNA sequencing business, and George M. Church, the Harvard University visionary who has been one of the leading inventors and users of DNA-sequencing, analyzing, and synthesizing technology over the past three decades. \n  George Church \n - When Enemies Become Allies In The War On Health Costs . We\u2019ve found a case of an insurer and a hospital system working together. The results are stunning. \n -We\u2019ll also be unveiling our list of the 30 most important people under 30 in health care at the event, and we\u2019ll ask the attendees to collaborate with us on another list, to discover health care\u2019s biggest disrupters. \n \nThat\u2019s just a taste. We also plan to look deep into the regulation of drugs, devices, and genetics at the Food and Drug Administration; to examine how wireless technologies could transform the relationships between doctors and patients; and how huge troves of data \u2013 and the ability to analyze them \u2013 could help us make our health care system better. I\u2019ll be detailing more of our plans in this space over the coming weeks. \n Anyone interested should shoot me an email. Tickets to this event can be purchased by invitation only.
