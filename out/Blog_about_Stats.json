Here\u2019s (a new) one: Linked Open Government Statistical Data LOGSD. \n LOGSD are statistical data official statistics agencies provide in a LOD format for reuse. And such reuse may combine (mash up) statistical LOD with other sources in the LOD Cloud . \n For example: ONS \n The Office of National Statistics  ONS and others in UK are very active in this field . So for better accessing geographical metadata which are essential in presenting statistics: \n \u2018The solution is to use\u00a0 data.gov.uk \u00a0as a single access point for discovery of geographic data, and to link from there to a geoportal (that is currently in development) where users could download the geographic products online. This goes most of the way to delivering the tools that users need to work with statistical data but there is also an opportunity to go further and provide geographic data as linked data, using the\u00a0 GSS codes \u00a0that uniquely identify each geography to link the attributes from the different geographic products.\u00a0Now, instead of a 9 character GSS identifier, each geography is given a URI that allows it to not only be uniquely identified but also makes it available online. We therefore end up with identifiers such as\u00a0 http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/E05008305 \u00a0that only require users to change the GSS code at the end to get to the geographic information that they need.\u2019 http://data.gov.uk/blog/update-from-ons-on-data-interoperability-0 \n Explain-a-LOD \n And here an example how LOD and statistical (not yet LOGSD) data could work together. It\u2019s an experimental proof of concept using data from Mercer quality of living survey and Transparency International, enriching these data with more information from DBpedia and calculating correlations that lead to hypotheses about the data. \n Heiko Paulheim from Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt made this interesting experiment which illustrates how linking data works.\u00a0Abstract of Paulheim\u2019s study \u201c Generating Possible Interpretations for Statistics from Linked Open Data\u2019 \u00a0: \n Statistics are very present in our daily lives. Every day, new statistics are published, showing the perceived quality of living in different cities, the corruption index of different countries, and so on. Interpreting those statistics, on the other hand, is a difficult task. Often, statistics collect only very few attributes, and it is difficult to come up with hypotheses that explain, e.g., why the perceived quality of living in one city is higher than in another. In this paper, we introduce Explain-a-LOD, an approach which uses data from Linked Open Data for generating hypotheses that explain statistics. We show an implemented prototype and compare different approaches for generating hypotheses by analyzing the\u00a0perceived quality of those hypotheses in a user study.\u2019 \n  \n Filed under: 023 Semantic Web , 037 Open data initiatives , 09 Stat.Office / Organization , United Kingdom Tagged: Linked open data , linked open government data , LOD"], "link": "http://blogstats.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/logsd/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://data.gov.uk/blog": 1, "http://statistics.gov.uk/": 1, "http://data.gov.uk/": 2, "http://blogstats.wordpress.com/": 8, "http://richard.cyganiak.de/": 1, "http://www.gov.uk/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Blog about Stats"}, {"content": ["What\u2019s the impact of Social Media?

Apps tend to \u201clock\u201d data away from other systems to \u00a0use, and by doing so contribute to the fragmentation of the overall information space. Instead, we should understand that apps come and go, \u00a0but data has longevity and should be the focus of our attention. Most importantly, we should keep in mind that sharing data can lead \u00a0to serendipitous reuse.\u2019 \n Lassila doesn\u2019t stop here and does more than propagating the Classic Web as standard against Apps. He goes a step further and makes the Semantic Web the standard for open data: \n \u2018The Semantic Web is seen as a set of technologies that can address the above problems and \u00a0lead us towards a future where \u00a0we don\u2019t isolate individual sets of data from others \u00a0(and from other uses).
