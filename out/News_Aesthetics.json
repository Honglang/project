Nowadays, DensityDesign is a research lab in the Design Department (INDACO) of the Politecnico di Milano. It focuses on the visual representation of complex social, organizational and urban phenomena. We do research with companies, public and private organizations and other research groups. \n How important are infographics? \n I see data and information visualization, which infographics are a subset, as a growing phenomena - the more data that is available and open, the more people need a way to access and make sense of it. Availability doesn\u2019t necessarily mean accessibility but infographics have the power to explain or in some cases to motivate people to go through the data. \n Do you think infographics make information easier to digest?  \n Sometimes yes, it really depends on the way they are designed. It\u2019s easy to make mistakes, to produce a misleading visualization, to lie, and not all the infographics are easy to digest. But this is not necessarily bad - we think that the primary goal is to communicate the very nature of the observed phenomenon, and often - especially in the case of social phenomena - it\u2019s a complex one. \n Do you think infographics should be used more often in the academic world? \n In terms of education, I think that in Italy, and generally in Europe, there\u2019s a lack of education in this area, especially for students in Communication Design degrees. It\u2019s a gap that we\u2019re trying to fill here at the Politecnico di Milano. We\u2019re also trying to bring our competences into other fields of education, for example, journalism. \n Do you collaborate with any other organisations? \n Most of the projects we\u2019re working on cannot be done by a team of designers alone.\u00a0In general the domain of visualization, in my perspective, is necessarily a multidisciplinary one. We usually work with people from statistics and computer science, semiotics, sociology and their respective research organizations, mostly public and private research centres based in other universities or schools. For example, we\u2019re currently working with a NGO in the US for our Dust project. \n Posted by Emine"], "link": "http://newsaesthetics.tumblr.com/post/4255816785", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.polimi.it/": 1, "http://www.densitydesign.org/": 2}, "blogtitle": "News Aesthetics"}, {"content": ["Via: Medical Insurance \n In an attempt to surpass the number of hits that Dave\u2019s post on penis size may generate, here is one on 20 strange sex laws by the Medical Insurance Blog . \n Who knew that it was illegal for a man in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, to have sex with a woman and her daughter at the same time or that in Cali, Columbia, the first time a woman has sex with her husband, her mother must be present to witness the act.\u00a0 \n N.B.

I joined the site because the project sounded great and it was a way for me to get into the internet world. \n What would you estimate your daily/weekly readership is? \n I would say we are getting between 10,000 and 11,000 viewers a week and is consistently increasing from month to month. \n Which newspaper/website do you think produces the best infographics? \n It\u2019s hard to say which one produces the best infographic, there are so many different companies making so many different types of infographics. Although the best type of infographic is an interactive one as well as most involving technology, especially apple. \n What do you see the role of infographics as in the modern media? \n I see infographics becoming a great method for marketing. They\u2019re the perfect medium, they\u2019re pictures, but they allow you to say so much. I\u2019d say infographics are the internet\u2019s elevator pitch. I foresee them becoming a great way to deliver news. It is rather difficult to find infographics for current events, I want to see more of them on the internet and hopefully that is something that can come true soon. \n What do you see as the future of infographics? \n There are so many ways to use an infographic whether it be for random facts, news, how-tos, as long as the content is relevant infographics will be around for a long time. It is a matter of making them \u201ccooler\u201d and more interactive, there are so many uses for the infographic that have yet to be tapped. \n Posted by Dave"], "link": "http://newsaesthetics.tumblr.com/post/4206419470", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.dailyinfographic.com": 1}, "blogtitle": "News Aesthetics"}, {"content": ["A little bit meta maybe, but here are two infographics showing the most commonly used sources and tags for visualisations on Many Eyes , as featured on the Guardian Data Blog . \n Both graphics\u00a0reveal that people are most interested in visualising data about\u00a0people, or\u00a0as the blog points out, \u201cwe are interested in statistics that tell us something about ourselves.\u201d \n This shows that, while the pretty graphics about climate change,\u00a0war and politics we have featured on News Aesthetics may be visually stunning, what people actually want to see visualised is information about themselves - about the census, education and, yes Ben, perhaps even penis size. \n It seems then, in infographics as in wider journalism, it is people, not events, which should be the driving force. \n Posted by Dave"], "link": "http://newsaesthetics.tumblr.com/post/4187695448", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.co.uk/": 1, "http://www-958.ibm.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "News Aesthetics"}, {"content": ["As the news coverage of Japan\u2019s nuclear plant crisis has shown, whenever radiation is mentioned, people tend to panic.

This entailed writing a profile on each of the survivors of the King\u2019s Cross blast, by condensing their testimonies from the coroner\u2019s inquests into 75 words. \n In the profiles, I was instructed to include quotes, background information, the victim\u2019s connection to other passengers and finally, any points about emergency services, as they had been criticised for not responding quickly enough. \n Extracting the information that I thought would be most interesting for the Guardian\u2019s readership was a difficult task, not only because there were thousands of words to trawl through, but because of the harrowing nature of the victims\u2019 accounts.
