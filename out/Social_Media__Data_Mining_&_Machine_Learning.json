[{"blogurl": "http://machine-learning.blogspot.com\n", "blogroll": [], "title": "Social Media, Data Mining & Machine Learning"}, {"content": ["Deadline: 1 December 2010 More info at ACM TIST webpage Social Media have been able to shift the way information is generated and consumed. At first, information was generated by one person and \u201cconsumed\u201d by many people, but nowadays most part of the information available in the Web is generated by users, which has changed the needs in information access and management. Social Networks like Facebook or Twitter manage tens of PB of information, with flows of hundreds of TB per day, and hundreds of billions of relationships. User generated content provides an excellent scenario to apply the metaphor of mining any kind of information. In a social media context, users create a huge amount of data where we can look for valuable nuggets of knowledge by applying diverse search (information retrieval) and mining techniques (data mining, text mining, web mining, opinion mining). In this kind of data, we can find both structured information (ratings, tags, links) and unstructured information (text, audio, video), and we have to learn how to combine existing techniques in order to take advantage of the existing information heterogeneity while extracting useful knowledge. The primary goal of this special issue of ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology is to foster research in the interplay between Social Media, Data/Opinion Mining and Search, aiming to reflect the actual developments on technologies that exploit user generated contents. Topics of Interest We invite researchers and professionals from a broad range of disciplines to submit to this special issue. Papers may encompass any or all of the following types of works: foundational theoretical analyses, modelling, simulation, and empirical studies. Moreover, authors may examine different aspects of search and mining user generated contents in a variety of possible contexts. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: \u2028A) Mining Social Media Social networks analysis/mining Tagging/links/graphs analysis and mining Community detection and evolution Influence, trust and privacy analysis Social media monitoring/analysis B) Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis Opinion extraction/classification/summarization/visualization Temporal sentiment analysis Cross-lingual/cross-domain sentiment analysis Irony detection in opinion mining Wish analysis Product review analysis C) Search in Social Media Novel social search algorithms Social ranking Multi-entity search Multifaceted search User Modelling and Personalization in Social Media D) Other Social Intelligent Systems Social Recommender systems Semantic Social Media Market analysis Cross-lingual/cross-domain social intelligent systems Submission Guidelines Manuscripts submitted to the special issue should contain original material not published in nor submitted to other journals. Each paper will be reviewed by at least 3 expert reviewers. Papers which do not meet publication quality standards, or does not pass the editorial assessment of suitability of this special issue will be rejected before the review process. Full papers should be sent via TIST's On-Line Submission system http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tist (please select \u201cSpecial Issue: Search and Mining User Generated Contents\u201d as the manuscript type), and should not exceed 20 pages length.

Formal languages have been standardized to define ontology-based knowledge representations, logic formalisms and query models. Ontology engineering methodologies and tools have been proposed to ease the designing and populating of ontological knowledge bases. Reasoning engines have been implemented to exploit inference capabilities of ontologies, and semantic-based frameworks have been built to enrich the functionalities of Web services. These achievements are the pillars to deal with the complex challenge of bringing semantics to the Web. The above gives a new ground to extend the focus of the Semantic Web by engaging it in other communities, where semantics can play an important role. The available semantic knowledge bases can be used to enrich and link additional repositories, ontology engineering techniques can be utilized to properly design and build ontologies in further real-world domains, and inference and query mechanisms can enhance classic information management and retrieval approaches. Among these communities, this workshop aims to attract the attention of students and professionals both from academia and industry who take benefit of semantic-based techniques and technologies in within-application Adaptation, Personalization and Recommendation approaches. In parallel to the progress made in the Semantic Web research topics, there have been appearing works in the above areas that use ontologies to model the user\u2019s preferences, tastes and interests, and exploit these personal features together with meta-information about multimedia contents in order to provide the user with adaptation and personalization capabilities for different purposes such as information retrieval and item recommendation. Moreover, with the advent of the Web 2.0 (also called the Social Web), the potential study and development of those approaches have increased exponentially. Social networks allow people to provide explicit relationships with others, and find out implicit user similarities based on their profiles. Social tagging services offer the opportunity to easily create and exploit personal knowledge representations. Wiki-style sites represent an environment where the community contributes and shares information, and blogs are media in which users express subjective opinions. In all of these scenarios, adaptation, personalization and recommendation are core functionalities. However, the understanding and exploitation of the semantics underlying user and item profiles are still open issues. ++++++++++++++++++ Topics of interest ++++++++++++++++++ The workshop will focus on establishing user/usage models for adaptation, personalization and recommendation approaches for the Social-semantic Web. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the exploitation of the Web of Data, the identification of semantics underlying social annotations of multimedia contents, and the application of semantic-based techniques and technologies in research fields related to:  * Personalized access to multimedia content * Content-based recommendation and collaborative filtering * Adaptive exploration of multimedia content * Adaptive user interfaces for multimedia content browsing and searching * Community extraction and exploitation * Social networks analysis for collaborative recommendation * User profile construction based on social tagging information * Context-aware multimedia content access and delivery * Mobile and ubiquitous multimedia content access and delivery ++++++++++++++++++++ Organizing Committee ++++++++++++++++++++  * Iv\u00e1n Cantador, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Spain * Peter Mika, Yahoo!

Google is the Intelligent Systems reference company due to their search engine, but also for the big quantity and quality of different technologies tehy develop like automated translation, user profiling, context management or even image processing. Amazon is a e-commerce store, and it seems not so correlated with technology as Google, but the vision of Jeff Bezos and their commitment to technology have allowed them to grow like anyone before in the e-commerce market. For Bezos, an online store should not limit their catalog to a few items, online stores should contain millions of products, and should personalize the user experience of their users. His vision was clear: \"if you have 3 million customers in the Web, I should have 3 million online stores\", and then the recommender system ruled Amazon. Both technologies (search and recommender systems) are useful for the Information Overload problem we suffer nowadays. But they're radically different from their conception. Search engines need the users to express their needs in textual form, and then process that query and retrieve the most relevant documents according to that query. Recommender Systems analyze the behaviour (and other kind of data) of the user in a website and then are able to choose the products or contents more likely to interest the user. Both approaches are useful, but until the moment recommender systems are not as popular as search engines. But we are in a turnaround in the Web, as the way information is generated and consumed has changed. Nowadays, due to the success of Social Media sites like Facebook or Twitter, and even to the success of previous technologies as RSS, we receive a lot of information in a passive way: we don't ask directly to receive that information, but we receive it. Until the moment, the problem was to find some important information, but now the problem is turning into choose what information I already receive is relevant to me. That's why I think recommender systems will replace in popularity to search engines in the future."], "link": "http://machine-learning.blogspot.com/feeds/701313943878695512/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Social Media, Data Mining & Machine Learning"}, {"content": ["DEADLINE: November 17, 2009. Multimedia content has become ubiquitous on the web, creating new challenges for indexing, access, search and retrieval. At the same time, much of this content is made available on content sharing websites like YouTube or Flickr, or shared on social networks like Facebook. In such environments, the content is usually accompanied with metadata, tags, ratings, comments, information about the uploader and their social network, etc. Analysis of these \"social media\" shows a great potential in improving the performance of traditional multimedia information analysis/retrieval approaches by bridging the semantic gap between the \"objective\" multimedia content analysis and \"subjective\" users' needs and impressions. The integration of these aspects however is non-trivial and has created a vibrant, interdisciplinary field of research. The Spring School on Social Media Retrieval aims at bringing together young researchers from neighboring disciplines, offering (1) lectures delivered by experts from academy and industry providing a clear and in-depth summary of state-of-the-art research in social media retrieval, (2) collaborative projects in small groups providing hands-on experience on integrative work on selected problems from the field.

Now we release the CFP hoping to receive high quality papers on Mining Social Media: OVERVIEW Recently, Forrester published a report, \u201cThe Future of the Social Web\u201d where they sketched a timeline of the development of the Social Web, dividing its evolution in 5 eras. According to that report, the first era of the development of the Social Web started to explode the social relationships among users. Then, in the social functionality era, these social relationships resulted in the social functionality era where several websites started to add social functionalities in order to help users to interact with their peers. We are now in the era of Social Colonization, where technologies like Facebook Connect or Google Friend Connect have standardized social functionalities among websites and a vast majority of websites now include several social functionalities. Soon these federated identities will empower people to enter the era of social context with personalized and social content, and the development of tools for personalize social content will aim the development of the era of social commerce. The primary goal of the proposed special issue of International Journal of Electronic Commerce is to foster research in the interplay between Social Media, Data Mining and Electronic Commerce, trying to reflect the actual developments on technologies that fit on the Social Context era.

In this post I resume what I wrote because I think it can be a good initial point for a debate about the present and future of Science. Talking about frauds in science can be quite long, there are many little things in the actual scientific process that should be corrected (fake conferences, strange publishing processes, etc.), but I'll focus on big frauds,. In August 2005, PLoS Medicine published \" Why Most Published Research Findings are False \", dealing with bad experimental design which conduces to wrong research findings. As stated in this paper, the scientific process is much focused in nobel research, and there is almost no support for research trying to replicate previous results, trying to corroborate previous findings. In the paper \" Repairing research integrity \" published in Nature, June 2008, Sandra Titus and her team analyzes the integrity on scientific studies. Based on a survey over more than 4.000 researchers from over 600 institutiones, the results showed more than 200 cases of bad conduct in some scientific study, a number much higher than the registered previously by ORI ( Office of Research Integrity ). More than 60% of the total meant to data falsification, being plagiarism the next more usual bad conduct detected. Some of these frauds are detected on time, as the Kristin Roovers case, that was discovered by the editors of The Journal of Clinical Investigations when he sent a paper containing some images that had been manipulated with Photoshop . There exists some regions where frauds are even a bigger problem. This is the case of China, where more than 60% of PhD students admit they have plagiarize some work . This represents a really big problem for China's research and even for the whole scientific community. Recently, another big fraud in science was discovered, when The Scientist informed that Elsevier, one of the biggest scientific publishers, has several agreements with companiers to publish scientific journals that the companies use to promote their products. The first case detected was the Australasian Journal of Bone and Joint Medicine, where a paper was published promoting a product from Merck, a company that paid Elsevier for designing this journal. Summer Johnson writes about this big fraud in Bioethics , a really recommended lecture. The scientific community must react to all these things, if we want to preserve the image of science but, what can we do? I think there are several options that could improve the scientific process: 1.- Open Access. The Elsevier case must make us to think that letting companies like Elsevier to control scientific publishing is not a good idea. Open Access seems a good way to prevent science from the desires and interests of big publishing companies. It is also a good way to assure an egalitarian access to scientific results. 2.- We should try to help iniciatives refering to negative results (or less important ones). Journals like Journal of Interesting Negative Results in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning , Journal of Negative Results on Biomedicine , or Journal of Negative Results , are doing a good job publishing that kind of results. 3.- It also seems very important to improve working conditions of researchers. For instance, in Spain a lot of researchers earn less money that if they were working in a supermarket or driving a taxi, occupations with less responsabilities and less impact in the society. Who can care about doing high quality research if can't give his/her family a decent living? 4.- It is also needed to take up again scientific ethics. As researchers we must value what science word means. Science is not about publishing papers, science is all about improving the global knowledge, science is something really great."], "link": "http://machine-learning.blogspot.com/feeds/8305936965056946694/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.plosmedicine.org/": 1, "http://www.csmonitor.com/": 1, "http://www.jnr-eeb.org/": 1, "http://www.the-scientist.com/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://weblogs.madrimasd.org/": 1, "http://ori.dhhs.gov/": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 1, "http://chronicle.com/": 1, "http://blog.bioethics.net/": 1, "http://jinr.uottawa.ca/": 2, "http://www.jci.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Social Media, Data Mining & Machine Learning"}, {"content": ["Gregory Piatetsky pointed in KDnuggets Twitter account the release of a data package containing 7 months of hourly pageview statistics for all articles in Wikipedia .
