Shelley Miller, a Montreal based artist, has been creating some highly detailed murals around the city which at first and even second glance appear to be made from victorian era blue and white tile. \n For most of her works Miller creates tiles of sugar and decorates them before affixing them to her chosen wall surface, using nothing more than sugar frosting for the task. Then in what is almost the culinary version of Andy Goldsworthy\u2019s temporal works (which are often destroyed by nature), these sugar based pieces slowly melt away. For many, their dripping blue forms are the first clue that they are even made of food ingredients. As it simply washes away with the rain, this art should also keep city officials fat and happy. \n See Also Scratching the Surface: Portraits Carved in Walls \n Miller doesn\u2019t limit herself to just his form of unique expression. She is currently working on a huge cement sculpture in the form of a cut log, molded completely out of old books.

The mobile web is the fastest growing online arena, now home to more than 4 billion connected smartphones. If statistics hold, mobile use will overtake desktop traffic by 2014. This is an important realization to be made, because no matter what type of business you run, your audience already is \u2014 or soon will be \u2014 on the mobile web, and reaching them on this platform should become a priority. \n The growing importance of mobile search is already being seen today. 90% of mobile searches result in an action such as visiting a business location or purchasing a product. People are using their smartphones to search destroy best deals like never before. They\u2019ll do research from their mobile on the product they\u2019re interested in, then use it to find the nearest location, and while at that location they\u2019ll go on again and search for a better deal online, or another physical location nearby. \n Apple\u2019s Siri may not have revolutionized mobile search overnight, but it did ruffle feathers and have people voicing their frustrations about Siri and other mobile search assistants as being the death of SEO. The truth is that Siri presents unique challenges and opportunities for marketers \u2014 as does any new platform \u2014 but when approached intelligently, you can use Siri to your advantage. \n See how to optimize your site for the mobile web with some best practice tips, and how to get along with Siri\u2019s search algorithm to make sure you and your business can excel in the mobile landscape. \n Click here or the graphic below for a full-sized view. \n  \n &#x1525; Alchemy Viral"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheVisualNews/~3/ISabLBlaxqA/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.curatorscode.org": 1, "http://www.visualnews.com/": 4, "http://www.alchemyviral.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Visual News"}, {"content": ["Check out your links after the jump. \n \n THE SUPER HAUNTING PHOTOGRAPHY OF ANDRZEJ DRAGAN \n \n I am a bird now \u2013 by Christan Martin Weiss \n \n Hourglass Sea By Kahn and Selesnick \n \n Claude Pauquet \n \n RowanDeVoe \n \n JON EDWARDS: BEAUTIFULLY HAUNTING PHOTOGRAPHY. \n \n Stephen King\u2019s \u201cThe Shining\u201d Cuckoo Clock \n \n Freaky Halloween snapshots: 1875-1955 \n \n IN L.A.: GARY BASEMAN\u2019S NIGHTMARES OF HALLOWEEN\u2019S PAST OPENING \n \n Evocative color photos taken between 1914-1918 \n \n EUG\u00c8NE ATGET: OLD PARIS EXHIBITION \n \n Yves KleinLeap into the Void (photographed by Harry Shunk) \n \n Desconceptualizado \u2013 Carlosbull \n \n Lead Image: Govia \u2013 Photographs of Abandoned Spaces \n For more art make an add request on the Facebook group Artsy !"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheVisualNews/~3/Syfr9sSKd1E/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://blog.com.au/": 1, "http://www.visualnews.com/": 2, "http://myloveforyou.typepad.com/": 1, "http://www.lostateminor.com/": 1, "http://designyoutrust.com/": 1, "http://boingboing.net/": 1, "http://www.claudepauquet.info/": 1, "http://bizarrebeyondbelief.com/": 1, "http://www.soultravelmultimedia.com/": 1, "https://www.facebook.com/": 1, "http://www.ignant.de/": 1, "http://www.juxtapoz.com/": 1, "http://www.etsy.com/": 1, "http://designspiration.net/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Visual News"}, {"content": ["Did you know pencil sculpting was a thing? That\u2019s right, using the common graphite filled writing device, artists are creating beautiful works of art which combine both the geometric, stackable nature of the lowly pencil, and the often organic forms of hand sculpted art. By glueing the hexagonal sticks of wood together and then carving the resulting block, large honeycomb-like structures can be created. Depending on if a colored pencil or graphite is used, the carved portions of the resulting forms reveal the inner writing material and form a flowing surface of pixilation. Today we bring you two sculptors working with this different medium: Australian Lionel Bawden and American Jessica Drenk. \n See Also Paper Sculptures from an Icon of Industrial Design \n Lionel Bawden has been working with arranging and carving colored pencils for about 10 years. His works range from undulating organic forms built out of graphite pencils to pill-like forms built out of carefully planned patterns of colored pencils. These latter works \u2013 which are also his most recent \u2013 are built and finished with such precision that they nearly hide their pencil based roots. \n See Bawden\u2019s fine work directly below, then continue reading for a look at the work of Jessica Drenk. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jessica Drenk , an artist based in Clemson, South Carolina, takes inspiration from the natural world. Her works, with the smeared grey of graphite on their carved surfaces, have the warn and weathered feel of driftwood; while the manufactured yellow exterior of the pencils she often uses provides a sharp contrast to this natural form. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n &#x1525; juxtapoz & artblart"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheVisualNews/~3/JaL0AqWi3rk/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.juxtapoz.com/": 1, "http://jessicadrenk.com/": 1, "http://www.curatorscode.org": 1, "http://artblart.com/": 1, "http://www.visualnews.com/": 3, "http://www.lionelbawden.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Visual News"}, {"content": ["The folks over at Pop Chart Labs have done it again, producing another extensive, poster-based charting of beautiful information.

My favorite part?

The chart helps to show the connections between shapes, visually demonstrating how many types stem from one another.
