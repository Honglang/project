[{"blogurl": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com\n", "blogroll": [], "title": "Genomics Law Report"}, {"content": ["Sara Huston Katsanis, MS is an Associate in Research at the Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy at Duke University. \n On September 5, 2012, a coordinated release of 30 articles in Nature , Cell , Science , Genome Research , Genome Biology \u00a0and other journals published the long-awaited findings of The Encylopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium. The press coverage of ENCODE data is deafening at this point, and ENCODE\u2019s relevance to GLR readers may not be immediately apparent. \n Across the U.S., numerous groups are challenging the integration of CODIS profiles (sometimes called \u201cDNA Fingerprints\u201d) into the routine booking procedures upon arrest for certain crimes (depending on the state), placing genetic profiling among other standard procedures such as fingerprinting and mug shot photographs. The GLR has covered these legal challenges previously (including here , here , and here ). \n On September 19, 2012, the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc heard oral arguments in Haskell v. Harris (formerly Haskell v. Brown ) challenging California\u2019s Proposition 69 (for the GLR\u2019s previous coverage, see here ). This week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, or EFF, filed a brief with the Ninth Circuit asking the court to take the recently published ENCODE findings into consideration, explaining on the EFF blog that ENCODE represents: \n ground-breaking new research that confirms for the first time that over 80% of our DNA that was once thought to have no function, actually plays a critical role in controlling how our cells, tissue, and organs behave\u2026[ENCODE] should have broad ramifications for federal and state DNA collection programs. \n With headline after headline after headline seemingly providing ample ammunition\u2013opponents of DNA profiling of arrestees are taking aim at the constitutionality of CODIS profiles. Those opponents contend that the portions of the genome once disregarded as mere non-protein-coding DNA (ncDNA, or, as the unfortunate phrase goes, \u201cjunk DNA\u201d) have been upgraded by ENCODE to \u201cfunctional\u201d portions of the genome. Though that claim is probably more robustly supported by the hype of ENCODE than ENCODE\u2019s actual findings , opponents of DNA profiling are nevertheless using ENCODE\u2019s findings to argue that CODIS profiles relay far more than just identification information and that, under a totality of the circumstances analysis (which is the legal argument that multiple courts in Haskell v. Harris have, thus far, used to find California\u2019s policy of DNA fingerprinting of felony arrestees constitutional), the interests of the government are far outweighed by privacy interests of individuals not yet convicted. \n As two scholars independent of the forensic science community but committed to the ethical, legal, and social implications of genome sciences, we investigated what is currently known about the current and recommended CODIS markers. Our research, conducted in October 2011 on the current draft of the human genome (hg19), was published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences within a week of the ENCODE publications and was cited by the California Attorney General in its reply to the EFF brief in Haskell v. Harris . \n In our Technical Note , \u201c Characterization of the Standard and Recommended CODIS Markers ,\u201d we found no evidence that CODIS genotypes are causative or predictive of known phenotypes. In the Letter , one of us urged the avoidance of the phrase \u201cjunk DNA.\u201d It is of immediate importance and interest to try to reconcile the ENCODE publications with our understanding of CODIS, both because of the professional arguments that have followed the ENCODE publications and because of, as the EFF\u2019s brief demonstrates, the inevitable use of ENCODE\u2019s data and hype to attempt to sway lawmakers, courts and jurors with respect to the appropriateness of DNA fingerprinting. 1 \n A brief introduction to ENCODE and CODIS is necessary before we explain that, while ENCODE (and the large body of scientific work developed prior to and in parallel with ENCODE) may have revealed that the genomic regions including the CODIS markers have some functionality, ENCODE has not demonstrated that CODIS genotypes have any known functionality or that the resulting CODIS profiles have any known direct positive or negative predictive value for inferring phenotypes. \n A brief introduction to ENCODE and CODIS . ENCODE, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements , is a federally supported, international research collaboration aimed at better understanding and cataloging the \u201cfunctional\u201d elements of the genome and is an important follow-up and supplement to the Human Genome Project . \n CODIS, the Combined DNA Index System , is a DNA database established by the FBI pursuant to congressional authorization by the DNA Identification Act of 1994. Since then, a number of federal statutes have authorized the collection of a DNA sample and creation of DNA profiles from individuals convicted of felonies. Similar databases and collection statutes exist worldwide, with Life Corporation ($LIFE) recently estimating that, \u201cto date, 44 countries have now implemented criminal offender DNA database programs with a combined offender sample pool of 40 million and growing.\u201d In the United States, the federal statutory authority expanding DNA profiling from those convicted of any federal felony to those arrested and charged with particular felonies is The DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005. Since its passage, more than half of the states have passed arrestee DNA Database laws. \n The DNA profiles used in CODIS consist of genotypes at a standard panel of 13 markers, all short tandem repeats or STRs. The consideration of an additional 11 STRs is ongoing, which could soon result in a standard profile consisting of genotypes at 24 markers. The statutory authorization for CODIS limits the DNA analysis to discovery of identification information and precludes DNA analysis that would disclose phenotypic information (such as an individual\u2019s appearance or health conditions), a point reiterated by the Department of Justice\u2019s Final Rule . \n  \n What does ENCODE currently mean for CODIS? The recent news of the functional significance of certain non-protein-coding regions of the genome has snowballed, in part thanks to some questionable constructions of ENCODE\u2019s actual findings, into assumptions that the CODIS markers (which are located in non-protein-coding regions of the genome) are\u2013or might be\u2013predictive of individual traits. This is largely a result of the misguided equating of \u201cmarker\u201d with \u201cgenotype.\u201d \n Even prior to ENCODE, it was a well-known fact that many of the CODIS markers are positioned within genomic regions associated with known traits. Some markers are even located within introns of genes with demonstrated causal relationships to known traits. And some of these genes are listed in OMIM, the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, which to geneticists means that the genes may be associated with disease. \n However, the genotypes of the CODIS markers (that is, the specific repeat lengths of As, Cs, Gs and/or Ts at the CODIS markers) have no known association (either statistical or causal) with any phenotype. They remain understood as \u201cpolymorphisms,\u201d even now that we know (or perhaps have re-learned, thanks to ENCODE), that the genes and genomic regions in which those markers occur may be largely functional (in the broad sense of that word). These genotypes could be in linkage disequilibrium with mutations associated with phenotypes, meaning that a genotype would be near enough to a mutation to be a statistical harbinger for that mutation. One marker, indeed, has a documented weak association of schizophrenia with a particular repeat length, but the association is so weak that the predictive value is negligible. That is, even if the police know that a person has this repeat-length genotype, the police could not predict whether that person is schizophrenic. \n CODIS genotype frequencies do vary by race and ethnicity, and to the extent that phenotypes also vary by race or ethnicity, CODIS profiles could indirectly be used to infer race and/or ethnicity and by extension could then be used to infer phenotypes. However, the statistical correlations are crude at best, as these markers are not robust ancestry informative markers (AIMs). Also of note, CODIS profiles routinely test for a polymorphism in the amelogenin gene that varies on the X- and Y- chromosomes. The genotype for amelogenin, therefore, (in most, but not all, cases) confers sex. But most important to the legal challenges at hand, the limited phenotypic information inferred from ameloginin or ancestry estimation is already decipherable from mug shot photos, so its redundant availability in the form of CODIS profiles is, or at least should be, unlikely to cause any notable controversy. \n The bottom line is that knowing a person\u2019s unique 13- or 24-marker profile at the genomic sites used by CODIS does not, to the best of our current knowledge, allow reliable, valid inference of anything more than identity (aside from sex) without performing additional analyses and drawing additional inferences from those analyses (e.g. estimating ancestry from the CODIS genotypes and subsequently performing analyses to infer phenotypes from those ancestry estimates). Importantly, the statutes establishing CODIS expressly prohibit the use of CODIS profiles for analysis other than identity. \n A shift in focus is needed . At this time, the courts (including the Ninth Circuit) hold the future of CODIS, and the expanded use of DNA-based technologies in law enforcement, in their hands. It is essential that the courts consider the constitutionality of DNA collection upon arrest within the context of existing scientific knowledge (and not conjectures driven by press releases). A clear understanding of the science, as presented by ENCODE and elsewhere, indicates that the real focus of the legal challenges to DNA profiling upon arrest should rest with the collection and retention of the DNA and the potential for future additional uses of those samples aside from CODIS and beyond identification, rather than an obsession with yet-to-be-discovered direct phenotypic predictive value of the current CODIS markers. That said, the choice of markers used by law enforcement must be flexible enough to respond to concerns of functionality that may be revealed through future scientific research; but, again, the existing set of markers \u2013 as far as we know today \u2013 do not convey information directly other than identity. \n The expanded use of DNA in law enforcement remains a concern for some of us in regards to the perpetuation of racial disparities of the CODIS database , the questionable utility of the expanded database in solving crimes and the appropriate allocation of resources for solving crimes and reducing evidence backlogs. \n Those are all important issues that should inform the ongoing conversation over the future of CODIS and similar databases worldwide. But to effectively have that conversation, we must first stop dwelling upon the currently nonexistent functionality of CODIS genotypes and shift the conversation back to the decision at hand \u2013 whether the collection and retention of DNA samples from innocent individuals is both constitutionally permissible and represents appropriate public policy. \n ________________________________ \n 1 The inevitable use of ENCODE\u2019s data and hype is not limited to the issue of DNA fingerprinting but includes opposition to evolution (For further reading, see here and here )."], "link": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/09/21/encode-codis-and-the-urgent-need-to-focus-on-what-is-scientifically-and-legally-relevant-to-the-dna-fingerprinting-debate/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.fbi.gov/": 2, "http://blogs.nature.com/": 1, "http://www.duke.edu/": 1, "http://www.fsijournal.org/": 1, "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 6, "http://www.sciencemag.org/": 1, "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/": 2, "http://www.genomeweb.com/": 1, "http://www.genome.gov/": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 2, "http://www.dnaresource.com/": 1, "https://www.eff.org/": 1, "http://news.pennmedicine.org/blog": 1, "http://www.usatoday.com/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://www.google.com/": 1, "http://arstechnica.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Genomics Law Report"}, {"content": ["The latest chapter in the Myriad gene patent litigation was written yesterday, with the Federal Circuit issuing its much anticipated opinion (pdf) after rehearing the case following the Supreme Court\u2019s unanimous decision earlier this year in Prometheus v. Mayo . \n Or perhaps we should say that the latest chapter was \u201crewritten\u201d as, in a move that surprised approximately nobody, and as we predicted earlier this spring , the Federal Circuit reached precisely the same result in its opinion today as it did last July when it issued its first substantive ruling in the Myriad litigation . Below, we examine how the Federal Circuit applied Mayo to Myriad , what the next step in the Myriad litigation is likely to be (spoiler alert: it\u2019s another appeal) and why we think the final opinion in this case, whenever it arrives and whatever it says, might not matter all that much. \n Applying Mayo to Myriad . As mentioned, the only major change since the last time the Federal Circuit ruled in Myriad , and the reason for the re-hearing, was the Supreme Court\u2019s decision earlier this spring in Mayo . \n However, Mayo was about method patents and the boundary between a patent-eligible method and a law of nature. It was not about product patents or the product of nature doctrine. Since the Federal Circuit had already invalidated all but one of Myriad\u2019s method patents even before the Supreme Court tightened the criteria for method patents in Mayo , it was hard to see much of substance changing the second time around. \n The Federal Circuit did not disappoint. \n Indeed, comparing the two Federal Circuit opinions reveals that, despite checking in at a hefty 106 pages, this week\u2019s opinion varies little in form, and even less in substance, from the 105-pager penned last summer. Here, for example, is a comparison of the official holding of the case, with new text highlighted in blue and old text struck through in red (a complete comparison of the two opinions is also available here \u00a0 (pdf) ) : \n On the threshold issue of jurisdiction, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to exercise declaratory judgment jurisdiction because we conclude that at least one plain-tiff, Dr. Harry Ostrer, has standing to challenge the validity of Myriad\u2019s patents. On the merits, we reverse the district court\u2019s decision that Myriad\u2019s composition claims to \u201cisolated\u201d DNA molecules cover patent-ineligible products of nature under \u00a7 101 since  because each of the claimed molecules as claimed do not exist in nature  represents a nonnaturally occurring composition of matter . We also reverse the district court\u2019s decision that Myriad\u2019s method claim to screening potential cancer therapeutics via changes in cell growth rates of transformed cells is directed to a patent-ineligible scientific principle. We , however, affirm the court\u2019s decision ,  however, that Myriad\u2019s method claims directed to \u201ccomparing\u201d or \u201canalyzing\u201d DNA sequences are patent ineligible; such claims include no transformative steps and cover only patent-ineligible abstract, mental steps. \n Substantively, the Federal Circuit reached the exact same result as last time around: one plaintiff (Dr. Ostrer) continues to have standing in the eyes of the court, allowing it to reach the merits of the case and affirm its position that, Mayo notwithstanding, (1) Myriad\u2019s gene patents (whether claiming cDNA or isolated DNA) are valid, (2) its diagnostic method patents are invalid and (3) its separate theareputic screening method patent is valid. \n Mayo , Myriad and Gene Patents. From the public\u2019s perspective, the most captivating aspect of the Myriad litigation from the very start has been the so-called \u201cgene patents.\u201d The issue is whether gene patents \u2013 or, more technically, compositions of matter comprising isolated DNA molecules \u2013 patent-eligible under \u00a7101 of the Patent Act or patent-ineligible under the longstanding \u201cproducts of nature\u201d doctrine. \n Despite the fact that Mayo dealt with process or method patents, and not product patents, both the majority opinion and the dissent attempted to analyze whether and how Mayo might inform the court\u2019s reasoning with respect to the patent-eligibility of isolated DNA sequences. \n According to Judge Lourie\u2019s majority opinion, Mayo was simply not applicable: \n The principal claims of the patents before us on remand relate to isolated DNA molecules. Mayo does not control the question of patent-eligibility of such claims. They are claims to compositions of matter, expressly authorized as suitable patent-eligible subject matter in \u00a7101. As to those claims, the issue of patent-eligibility remains, as it was on the first appeal to this court, whether they claim patent-ineligible products of nature. (Lourie, 38) \n Despite the \u201cvaluable insights\u201d provided by Mayo , Judge Lourie\u2019s opinion reached the same conclusion as last summer: isolated DNA molecules are not found in nature, do not represent products of nature and, therefore, are patent-eligible. \n In her concurrence, Judge Moore reiterated that isolated DNA represented a close call in the abstract, but was clearly patent-eligible in light of the historical context: \n If I were deciding this case on a blank canvas, I might conclude that an isolated DNA sequence that includes most or all of a gene is not patentable subject matter. The scope of the law of nature/manifestation of nature exception was certainly enlarged in\u00a0 Prometheus . But we do not decide this case on a blank canvas\u2026There are no thousands of patents with claims to isolated DNA, and some unknown (but certainly large) number of patents to purified natural products\u2026we must be particularly wary of expanding the judicial exception to patentable subject matter where both settled expectations and extensive property rights are involved. (Moore, 13-14) \n Then there was Judge Bryson, who agreed with the majority on the method claims and on the patentability of cDNA, but dissented on isolated DNA. Judge Bryson\u2019s dissenting opinion\u00a0provided a window into why some commentators \u2013 as well as the plaintiffs \u2013 speculated that Mayo might call for a different result with respect to Myriad\u2019s gene patents. Here, quoted at some length, is Judge Bryson\u2019s interpretation of how Mayo ought to have altered the court\u2019s analysis of the patent-eligibility of isolated DNA sequences: \n In Mayo , which involved method claims\u2026the [Supreme] Court found that the method was not directed to patent-eligible subject matter because it contributed nothing \u201cinventive\u201d to the law of nature that lay at the heart of the claimed invention\u2026In concluding that the claims did not add \u201cenough\u201d to the natural laws, the Court was particularly persuaded by the fact that \u201cthe steps of the claimed processes\u2026involve well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by researchers in the field.\u201d \n Just as a patent involving a law of nature must have an \u201cinventive concept\u201d that does \u201csignificantly more than simply describe\u2026natural relations,\u201d\u2026 a patent involving a product of nature should have an inventive concept that involves more than merely incidental changes to the naturally occurring product. In cases such as this one, in which the applicant claims a composition of matter that is nearly identical to a product of nature, it is appropriate to ask whether the applicant has done \u201cenough\u201d to distinguish his alleged invention from the similar product of nature. Has the applicant made an \u201cinventive\u201d contribution to the product of nature? Does the claimed composition involve more than \u201cwell-understood, routine, conventional\u201d elements? Here, the answer to those questions is no. \n Neither isolation of the naturally occurring material nor the resulting breaking of covalent bonds makes the claimed molecules patentable\u2026.The functional portion of the composition\u2014the nucleotide sequence\u2014remains identical to that of the naturally occurring gene. \n The majority suggests that I have \u201cfocus[ed] not on the differences between isolated and native DNAs, but on one similarity: their informational content.\u201d In light of Mayo , that approach seems appropriate. (Bryson, 14-16, internal citations omitted) \n The other two Federal Circuit judges declined to follow Judge Bryson\u2019s extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in Mayo from laws of nature to products of nature. Still, the roadmap that Judge Bryson laid out \u2013 specifically that an isolated DNA sequence lacks an inventive product or process to distinguish it from its naturally-occurring counterpart, and that the two are identical in their informational content rendering the isolated DNA not patent-eligible \u2013 seems to be one that the Supreme Court might plausibly follow if it (a) agrees to hear Myriad following the inevitable appeal and (b) agrees that isolated DNA sequences representing human genes are not patent-eligible. \n What Myriad Means Now. As for what the Federal Circuit\u2019s most recent opinion means for the moment, we think the answer is an unequivocal \u201cnothing new.\u201d The Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling remained substantively unchanged post- Mayo , a result which was entirely expected. \n If that outcome represents a \u201c win for Myriad ,\u201d as has been claimed, it is only because the status quo has been preserved for another year. For a company that is currently thriving \u2013 despite the ongoing litigation, Myriad recently reported that its BRACAnalysis revenues topped $400 million during the company\u2019s most recent fiscal year , representing a 15% increase over the previous year \u2013 maintaining the status quo probably is a good thing, at least in the short term. \n The near-certain next step in the Myriad litigation, as it always seems to be, is another appeal, either en banc to the entire Federal Circuit and/or to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court already granted certiorari once, albeit briefly, and given that court\u2019s recent interest in high-profile patent cases (e.g., Bilski and Mayo ) and Myriad\u2019s even higher profile, there\u2019s certainly a strong possibility the Supremes will agree to hear the case. If so, a resolution on the merits would appear most likely in 2013, with 2014 as an outside possibility. \n Myriad\u2019s Long-Term Implications: Watching the Watchers . Looking ahead, it appears increasingly unlikely that Myriad\u2019s denouement, when it finally arrives in 2013 or 2014, will produce a significant effect one way or the other on either Myriad or the personalized medicine industry. We think this is likely to be true regardless of the litigation\u2019s substantive outcome. \n For Myriad, win or lose in court, its challenged patents will expire by the end of 2015. But the company\u2019s additional patents (the litigation involves only a small minority of Myriad\u2019s overall BRCA portfolio), its decades of experience as the sole provider of clinical BRCA diagnostic testing and its proprietary database of BRCA mutation information should allow Myriad to comfortably maintain its advantage in the marketplace against would-be direct competitors of clinical BRCA diagnostic testing. \n More broadly, competition for single-gene diagnostic providers like Myriad is expected to increase thanks to a growing cohort of companies deploying next-generation sequencing platforms to develop multiplex or whole-genome diagnostic and interpretive products. The price for these broad-based products is expected to rival what Myriad and other similar companies currently charge to analyze only one or two individual genes. And the technology employed by these companies \u2013 which include Genomic Health, Foundation Medicine, GenomeQuest, Ingenuity, Personalis, Silicon Valley Biosystems and many, many others \u2013 may very well invent around any Myriad-style gene patents on isolated DNA sequences that manage to survive both legal challenge and patent expiration, although that proposition has yet to be tested in court. \n With gene patents unlikely to pose a threat, and diagnostic method patents seriously weakened post- Mayo (as affirmed by the latest Myriad decision), does the ultimate outcome in Myriad much matter at this point for the personalized medicine industry? \n Not so much, in our view. While the case could still carry important and long-lasting ramifications for the patent-eligibility of certain products, particularly if the Supreme Court utilizes Myriad to clarify more than a century of convoluted \u201cproduct of nature\u201d jurisprudence, the greater impact \u2013 at least as far as the personalized medicine industry is concerned\u00a0\u2013 is likely to come from the public and political reaction to the case. \n One interesting change in the Federal Circuit\u2019s opinion this time around, as compared to last summer, was the lengths to which the court went to clarify what Myriad is not about, at least as far as the court is concerned: \n \u00a0It is not about whether individuals suspected of having an increased risk of developing breast cancer are entitled to a second opinion. Nor is it about whether the University of Utah, the owner of the instant patents, or Myriad, the exclusive licensee, has acted improperly in its licensing or enforcement policies with respect to the patents. The question is also not whether is it [sic] desirable for one company to hold a patent or license covering a test that may save people\u2019s lives, or for other companies to be excluded from the market encompassed by such a patent \u2013 that is the basic right provided by a patent, i.e., to exclude others from practicing the patented subject matter. (Lourie, 37) \n \u00a0And again: \n Whether [isolated DNA\u2019s] unusual status as a chemical entity that conveys genetic information warrants singular treatment under the patent laws as the district court did is a policy question that we are not entitled to address\u2026.Congress is presumed to have been aware of the issue, having enacted a comprehensive patent reform act during the pendency of this case, and it is ultimately for Congress if it wishes to overturn case law and the long practice of the PTO to determine that isolated DNA must be treated differently from other compositions of matter to account for its perceived special function. (Lourie, 49-50) \n Even if the Federal Circuit is intent in remaining above the political fray, the fact of the matter remains that the special status of gene patents \u2013 and issues like second opinion testing and exclusive licensing regimes \u2013 are exactly why the Myriad litigation was brought in the first place, and what it is ultimately about. \n Breast cancer remains, unfortunately, a widespread disease, affecting more than 1 out of every 10 women born today . Genetic tests can reliably indicate whether a woman is at such a greatly increased risk of developing breast cancer, for example due to deleterious genetic mutations in her BRCA-1 and/or BRCA-2 genes, that she should consider a serious medical intervention such as a prophylactic mastectomy. Patents awarded on the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes, as well as on related diagnostic methods, allowed Myriad Genetics to develop a diagnostic test which generates more than $400 million dollars in annual revenue, and is widely accessible to women in this country and reimbursed by most insurers. At the same time, the exclusivity provided by those same patents means that the woman is unable to obtain a confirmatory genetic test before choosing to undergo serious surgery. \n This leads to a debate that is easy to understand. These patents argue the plaintiffs, \u201c restrict both scientific research and patients\u2019 access to medical care .\u201d On the other hand, argue patent proponents, the government\u2019s \u201clong-term policy of protecting isolated DNA molecules has resulted in an explosion of innovation in the biotechnology industry\u2026Holding isolated DNA not patentable would destroy long settled industry expectations\u2026\u201d and do irreparable damage to that very same industry. (Lourie, 22) \n At root, this is what Myriad is and always has been about \u2013 not arguments about whether isolated DNA sequences should be patent eligible because they are (or are not) akin to elemental lithium or a leaf on a tree or the fine distinctions of where and how chemical bonds are cleaved. Myriad is a touchstone for the public, the media, industry and policymakers not for its legal holding but for the manner in which it embodies our continuing struggle to balance the benefits and costs of personalized medicine. \n The future of personalized medicine hinges upon the ability to strike the appropriate balance between the desire of patients, providers and payers for broad and affordable access to personalized medicine products against the demands of the corporations, investors and shareholders who require a return on the capital that must be invested to produce those very same personalized medicine products. And patents are only one piece of the puzzle. The same factors are also at play as we seek to overhaul reimbursement regimes and regulatory structures to accommodate personalized medicine. \n Which is why, in the end, what really matters in Myriad is not whether any of the specific patents stand or fall. What matters at this point is how the public and policymakers respond to Myriad as they seek to update legal, regulatory and reimbursement regimes in 2013 and beyond. The final legal result, whenever it is handed down, is likely in the end to be little more than a footnote to that conversation."], "link": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/08/17/applying-mayo-to-myriad-latest-decision-brings-no-new-news/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.fiercebiotech.com/": 1, "http://www.cancer.gov/": 1, "http://www.aclu.org/": 1, "http://www.genomeweb.com/": 1, "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 11}, "blogtitle": "Genomics Law Report"}, {"content": ["Amit Bhagwandass is a rising third-year student at University of North Carolina School of Law . \n New rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have an appreciable impact on the way that hospitals, nursing homes and other inpatient and outpatient health care providers will monitor their patients in the future. The new FCC rules enable the use of Medical Body Area Networks (MBANs).\u00a0MBANs are low-power wideband networks consisting of multiple body-worn sensors that transmit various patient data to a control device that collects data from the sensors. \n Wireless devices operating on the MBAN spectrum can be used to continuously monitor a patient\u2019s health by measuring indicators such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure and electrocardiogram results.\u00a0Additionally, wireless health devices can include mobile devices and associated applications of increasing relevance to consumer health and personalized medicine, such as mobile-device enabled sensors that monitor vital signs for any number of traits or conditions like blood pressure, glucose levels or even the early signs of an asthma attack . \n Among the benefits of MBAN use are improved patient outcomes and comfort due to increased mobility as patients are untethered from the cables that restrict them to a hospital bed. Additionally, there is decreased risk of hospital- acquired infection for patients .\u00a0Furthermore, wireless devices using MBANs lower costs by giving physicians real-time and accurate data and allowing them to intervene prior to more drastic deterioration.\u00a0This creates more opportunities for preventative care and continuous monitoring of chronic conditions .\u00a0It has been estimated that wireless monitoring technology could save as much as $197 billion over the next 25 years in the United States. 1 \n While it is likely that the majority of the early utilization of MBANs will be on an inpatient basis, in-home use of MBANs for monitoring patients with chronic illness will likely increase as the technology develops .\u00a0At the FCC\u2019s June 6, 2012 mHealth Summit, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced that the FCC intends to amend its rules to create more flexibility for experimental uses of the spectrum for wireless health care technologies . \n In addition to the FCC\u2019s oversight of MBAN broadband networks, MBAN equipment will also generally be required to gain approval or clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if such equipment qualifies as a medical device .\u00a0The FDA and FCC have jointly committed to working together to clarify and streamline the regulatory processes for evaluating the safety and efficacy of wireless-enabled medical devices , including MBANs and other mobile devices, while encouraging innovation and affording the public the potential benefit of these devices.\u00a0In 2007 draft guidance entitled \u201c Radio Frequency Wireless Technology in Medical Devices ,\u201d the FDA commented that wireless medical device manufacturers should maintain wireless quality of service, wireless coexistence and the integrity and security of data transmitted wirelessly. \n Among the concerns facing the FDA as they develop guidelines for MBAN manufacturers is the vulnerability of wireless medical devices to hacking. The Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB), which advises the Office of Management and Budget, recently proposed that the FDA or another federal agency assess the security of medical devices before they are sold .\u00a0Additionally, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is currently preparing a report on the security vulnerability of wireless medical devices .\u00a0These developments, and continued industry, user and provider education efforts, are likely to significantly influence the FDA\u2019s guidance and enforcement decisions regarding the development and distribution of MBANs and other mobile devices and applications as they continue to proliferate in coming years. \n Early MBAN proponents have continued to develop the technology ,\u00a0despite the fact that there is no federal reimbursement for MBAN utilization and some concerns exist regarding their implementation. Among the concerns is the risk that harmful disturbance or interference from other frequency bands will prevent the accurate transmission of the medical data through MBANs. In order to mitigate this risk, the FCC will require registration for MBAN use at health care facilities .\u00a0Furthermore, the FCC does not find the risk of interference threatening because MBAN devices may operate over relatively short distances and at a low power, which decreases the risk of interference disrupting the transmission of medical data.\u00a0In any event, it is likely that the FDA will address this risk as it develops standards for the approval of MBAN equipment. \n In addition to the FCC and the FDA overlay, MBANs also present significant HIPAA compliance concerns, as well as other data privacy concerns, particularly with respect to the security of the sensitive personal health data being transmitted by such devices .\u00a0Health care providers and others utilizing or contemplating the use of MBANs at their facilities, and companies developing MBANs or other innovative wireless medical devices and applications, should consult with counsel to ensure that they are in compliance with the FCC and FDA rules, HIPAA and other federal and state regulations. \n ______________________________ \n 1\u00a0 Robert Litan, Vital Signs via Broadband: Remote Monitoring Technologies Transmit Savings , Better Health Care Together Coalition, October 24, 2008."], "link": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/08/08/removing-the-cables-new-fcc-rule-paves-way-for-utilization-of-wireless-medical-technology/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 1, "http://www.gereports.com/": 1, "http://www.natlawreview.com/": 1, "http://csrc.nist.gov/": 1, "http://mobihealthnews.com/": 1, "http://www.mwe.com/": 2, "http://www.unc.edu/": 1, "http://www.fcc.gov/": 5, "http://www.informationweek.com/": 1, "http://online.wsj.com/": 1, "http://www.fda.gov/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Genomics Law Report"}, {"content": ["Last week, personal genetics company 23andMe announced that it had formally delivered the first round of documentation to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an attempt to receive 510(k) clearance for its consumer product. \n 23andMe declared itself \u201cfirst in the [ direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing] industry to announce it is working towards FDA clearance.\u201d That first followed another first for the company earlier in the summer: 23andMe\u2019s first patent, which covers a method of predicting susceptibility to Parkinson\u2019s Disease . \n I sat down last week with The Burrill Report to discuss 23andMe\u2019s recent activities and their implications for the future of DTC genetic testing and personalized medicine .

Specifically, Title II of GINA prohibits employers with more than 15 employees, employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor-management training and apprenticeship program committees from using genetic information when making employment decisions (e.g. hiring, firing, promotions, placement, compensation, privileges, seniority, etc). \n The employment discrimination provisions took effect on November 21, 2009, with an air of uncertainty, as the Final Rules implementing Title II of GINA were not issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) until a year later (See 75 Fed Reg 68912-68939 \u00a0[pdf], issued November 9, 2010) and did not take effect until January 10, 2011. (See previous GLR coverage of GINA Title II here and of GINA generally here ). \n  EEOC v. Nestle Prepared Foods. A recent case reminds us of the evidentiary hurdles generally present in employment discrimination litigation that GINA did not address. In June of 2010, Michael Peel filed a charge of genetic discrimination in employment with the EEOC against his former employer, Nestle Prepared Foods. According to the opinion and order issued on May 23, 2012, by Senior District Judge Hood in EEOC v. Nestle Prepared Foods , 2012 WL 1888130 (E.D. Kentucky, 2012), Mr. Peel\u2019s charge of discrimination was based on \u201cretaliation\u201d and \u201cgenetic information.\u201d 1 The charge alleged that during his employment with Nestle Prepared Foods, Mr. Peel was required to complete a \u201cfitness-for-duty\u201d medical examination, that the medical examination included collection of his family medical history, and that his employer terminated his employment within one month of the medical examination. \n GINA defines \u201cgenetic information\u201d broadly to include family medical history. Employers and other covered entities may still require employees to undergo medical examinations for job fitness; however, family medical history is not to be involved in such employment medical exams . As Judge Hood\u2019s order notes, Mr. Peel did not elaborate on his allegation of \u201cgenetic discrimination\u201d in his complaint to the EEOC, but it subsequently became \u201cclear that that portion of the charge relates to Dr. McLaughlin\u2019s [the private physician to whom Mr. Peel was sent by Nestle] acquisition of Peel\u2019s family medical history.\u201d \n During the administrative handling of Mr. Peel\u2019s charge of discrimination under GINA Title II, the EEOC issued a subpoena directing Nestle to disclose company documents showing employment decisions involving any employee or other person who, at Nestle\u2019s request,\u00a0was subjected to a medical examination\u00a0from approximately six months before the alleged incident involving Mr. Peel to the present day, including hiring and firing decisions with respect to such individuals. Nestle refused to produce the evidence, so the EEOC then petitioned the Eastern District Court of Kentucky to enforce the subpoena. \n Senior District Judge Hood rejected the EEOC\u2019s petition to enforce the subpoena, holding that the information that the EEOC sought to obtain was \u201cirrelevant to the charge being investigated.\u201d \n In previous proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, which had ruled in favor of the EEOC and ordered Nestle to comply with the EEOC\u2019s subpoena, the EEOC had argued that a broad review of Nestle\u2019s practices with respect to medical examinations for current and potential employees was relevant to see if the alleged GINA violation in Mr. Peel\u2019s case might also have occurred with respect to other Nestle employees or potential employees. \n In essence, the EEOC, through its investigation of Mr. Peel\u2019s claim of individual disparate treatment, was interested in simultaneously exploring whether there was evidence of systematic disparate treatment. While acknowledging that \u201cit is well established that the EEOC has broad access to evidence that is relevant to a charge being investigated,\u201d and that the relevance standard is to be \u201cconstrued expansively,\u201d Judge Hood was unprepared to stretch the meaning of \u201crelevant\u201d to the degree requested by EEOC. Or, as Judge Hood put it, to grant the EEOC\u2019s subpoena \u201cwould eviscerate the relevance requirement and condone fishing expeditions\u201d (citing EEOC v. K-Mart Corp., 694 F.2d 1055, 1066). Judge Hood explained further that, \u201cwhile the Court recognizes that it is important for the EEOC to have the ability to investigate possible patterns of discriminatory action, this does not mean that every charge of discrimination justifies an investigation of the employer\u2019s facility-wide employment practices\u201d (citing EEOC v. Burlington N. Santa Fe R.R. , 669 F.3d 1154, 1157-1158). \n The Burden of Enforcing GINA. As one of us pointed out previously, 2 cases with direct evidence of discrimination are unusual, and most alleged victims have little choice but to try to prove individual disparate treatment claims using circumstantial evidence to show either a pretext or mixed-motive for the employment decision at issue. While GINA expanded the scope of federally prohibited discrimination to include the use of genetic information by certain employers, including family history, GINA did not address the burden shifting involved in establishing that discrimination has actually occurred (See McDonnell Douglas v. Green , 411 U.S. 792 (1973) and Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , 490 U.S. 228 (1989), respectively) or alleviate other evidentiary burdens of employment discrimination claims. \n EEOC v. Nestle Prepared Foods underscores that even the EEOC \u2013 the agency charged with investigating and enforcing GINA\u2019s Title II proscriptions \u2013 is not possessed with unrestrained investigatory tools. The opinion, perhaps lending credence to the notion that GINA is more bark than bite, suggests that the EEOC may need to show allegations of discrimination from multiple victims before courts will compel employers, particularly large corporate employers like Nestle, to produce corporate records that would facilitate a broad investigation of potential systematic disparate treatment. It seems likely that the EEOC will need to pursue other lines of inquiry to substantiate such claims (such as interviewing coworkers identified or known by the victim filing the charge of discrimination) and have, as this court indicated is required, \u201carticulable circumstances that suggest the existence of violations beyond those specified\u201d in the original charge before courts force employers to throw open their file cabinets in the name of investigating and enforcing GINA. \n More broadly, the Nestle case is a reminder that GINA remains a relatively new piece of legislation. The most recent enforcement statistics published by the EEOC, which cover fiscal years 2010-2011 , show an extremely modest number of charges of discrimination received by the Commission allege genetic discrimination (201 in 2010, 245 in 2011). Just how modest those numbers are is perhaps more easily appreciated when one considers that the EEOC received nearly 100,000 total charges of discrimination in each of those two years and, as the Nestle case highlights, adding a charge of genetic discrimination to an EEOC complaint is as simple as checking the box on a standard EEOC-provided form. 3 \n Raising awareness and, ultimately, appropriate enforcement of GINA will clearly take both time and a concerted effort by the EEOC and other federal and state authorities. A major part of that effort will include continuing to educate individuals, employers and, yes, even courts about GINA\u2019s requirements and the challenges of identifying and preventing discrimination in the genetic age. \n ______________________ \n 1 The charge also appears to have included discrimination on disability, which is not relevant to the opinion and order. \n 2 Wagner JK. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008: Minimal protections but maximum publicity. Presented at the ASHG Annual Meeting. Philadelphia, PA 2008. \n 3 The EEOC enforcement data further show that, of the charges of discrimination filed that alleged genetic discrimination, the EEOC investigations led to determinations that there was reasonable cause to believe genetic discrimination occurred in just 13 of those instances. While itself a very low number, the 13 charges exhibiting reasonable cause out of 446 total charges in the most two recent fiscal years is generally in line with the rate at which EEOC finds reasonable cause for discrimination charges more broadly."], "link": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/06/20/the-burden-of-enforcing-gina-eeoc-v-nestle-illustrates-one-challenge-in-pursuing-genetic-discrimination-claims/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://ky.findacase.com/": 1, "http://www.eeoc.gov/": 3, "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 5}, "blogtitle": "Genomics Law Report"}, {"content": ["Earlier this week 23andMe, the Silicon Valley-based personal genomics company, was awarded its first patent:\u00a0 US Patent Number 8,187,811, entitled \u201cPolymorphisms associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease\u201d . \n 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki announced the issuance of the patent via a post on the company\u2019s blog late Monday evening , attempting to strike a tenuous balance between her company\u2019s oft-championed philosophical devotion to providing individuals with \u201cunfettered access to their genomes\u201d and its desire to commercialize the genomic information so many of those very same individuals have shared, free of charge, with 23andMe. With its new patent, 23andMe also injected itself into the middle of what Wojcicki herself described as the\u00a0\u201chot debate\u201d surrounding the patentability of\u00a0\u201cinventions related to genetics.\u201d Wojcicki\u2019s announcement appeared to catch more than a few of the company\u2019s customers by surprise, sparking concern about the company\u2019s intentions\u00a0on 23andMe\u2019s blog , Twitter and elsewhere, along with rapid and pointed commentaries from Stuart Hogarth \u00a0and Madeleine Ball , among others. \n Of the various questions asked of and about 23andMe and its new patent, these may be the three most common:\u00a0 Where did this patent come from, and why didn\u2019t I hear about it before?\u00a0What does 23andMe\u2019s patent cover?\u00a0How is 23andMe going to use its patent? Let\u2019s take each question in turn. \n 1.\u00a0 Where did this patent come from, and why didn\u2019t I hear about it before?\u00a0 Just over three years ago, 23andMe announced that it was launching its Parkinson\u2019s Disease Genetics Initiative in collaboration with The Parkinson\u2019s Institute and Clinical Center and The Michael J. Fox Foundation . In the years that followed, the company regularly touted (see, e.g., here , here , here and here ) the scientific progress that it was making, frequently crediting its novel research model which leveraged an engaged customer base willing to freely share not only personal genetic information but also the medical and family history, lifestyle, environmental and other phenotypic data so critical to untangling the complex relationship between genes, environment and traits. \n Indeed, in a paper published last summer in PLoS Genetics in which 23andMe confirmed several existing genetic variants associated with late-onset Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) susceptibility and identified two new variants , 23andMe\u2019s research was newsworthy less for its scientific contributions to the understanding of PD than for its validation of the company\u2019s research model. As Chuong B. Do and his 23andMe colleagues wrote, their research: \n \u2026illustrates the ability of web-based methods for enrollment and data collection to yield new scientific insights into the etiology of disease, and it demonstrates the power and reliability of self-reported data for studying the genetics of Parkinson\u2019s disease. \n But for all of the digital ink that 23andMe spilled in the past three years in highlighting both its scientific progress and the broader utility of its web-based research platform , the company maintained a persistent public silence with respect to its concurrent pursuit of intellectual property protection 1 (23andMe\u2019s first provisional patent application was filed in late 2009, the same year it launched its PD initiative). \n To be clear, it\u2019s not as if it was a secret that 23andMe was pursuing a PD-related patent. After all, in keeping with the Constitutional aims underlying the United States patent system , patents and patent applications, and the inventions they purport to describe, are matters of public record. Accordingly, 23andMe\u2019s\u00a0 patent application , which was filed November 2010 and published June 2011, had been publicly available for nearly a year before the final patent issued, and had during that time been a topic of discussion at academic conferences, in blog posts and in private industry conversations. \n Still, with more than a half million other patent applications published by the PTO in 2011 , and most of 23andMe\u2019s customers having lives and careers outside of personal genomics, the odds were very good that the vast majority of the company\u2019s customers were never going to learn of its patent plans until 23andMe itself made an announcement. \n Which brings us to Monday evening and to our second question. \n 2.\u00a0 What does 23andMe\u2019s patent cover? One of the oddest aspects of 23andMe\u2019s press release was how vague it was in describing the nature of the company\u2019s patent, along with its failure to provide a patent number or, better yet, a copy of or link to the patent itself. 2 \n Here\u2019s what co-founder Anne Wojcicki wrote instead: \n Our patent, \u201cPolymorphisms Related to Parkinson\u2019s Disease\u201d is expected to issue on Tuesday, May 29, 2012.\u00a0This relates to our discovery of a variant in the SGK1 gene that may be protective against Parkinson\u2019s disease in individuals who carry the rare risk-associated LRRK2 G2019S mutation. \n Saying that the patent \u201c relates to our discovery of a variant\u201d (emphasis added) in a Parkinson\u2019s disease gene does not give a reader a very good sense at all of the specific invention covered by 23andMe\u2019s patent.\u00a0That requires a review of the patent itself, which is available from both the PTO and the\u00a0 GLR , and in particular the \u201cClaims\u201d section where the invention itself is described. \n Claims in 23andMe\u2019s Issued Patent . The claims section itself is fairly short but, for our purposes, we can shorten it further by focusing on the four key claims, which read as follows: \n 1.\u00a0\u00a0 A method for screening a human subject for susceptibility to Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), the method comprising: obtaining a nucleic acid sample from the human subject; determining which allele is present in the sample at the polymorphic nucleotide position of SNP rs10513789 (SEQ ID NO: 1); and identifying the human subject as having an increased risk of developing PD if the subject has a T at the polymorphic nucleotide position of rs10513789 (SEQ ID NO: 1). \n 5.\u00a0 The method of claim 1, further comprising determining which allele is present in the sample at one or more of the polymorphic nucleotide positions selected from the group of SNPs consisting of rs6599389 (SEQ ID NO: 2), rs873785 (SEQ ID NO: 3), rs11248060 (SEQ ID NO: 4), rs6812193 (SEQ ID NO: 5), rs4130047 (SEQ ID NO: 6), rs7451962 (SEQ ID NO: 7) and rs4397141 (SEQ ID NO: 8). \n 6.\u00a0 A method for generating a prognosis of a human subject\u2019s susceptibility to Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), comprising:\u00a0obtaining a genomic sample from said human subject; analyzing the genomic sample to determine which allele is present in the sample at the polymorphic nucleotide position of SNP rs10513789 (SEQ ID NO: 1); storing the determined allele of the sample in a database that includes a set of information related to said subject; correlating the determined allele with an association between the alleles of rs10513789 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and susceptibility to PD in the database; generating a prognosis of the subject\u2019s susceptibility to PD based on the correlation; and communicating the prognosis of susceptibility to a medical practitioner. \n 7.\u00a0 The system of claim 6 wherein the set of information related to said subject comprises family medical history, diet, exercise and medical history of said subject. \n To put it in slightly simpler terms, 23andMe\u2019s patent claims a method of (a) screening human subjects for PD susceptibility based on examining variations at eight separate positions in the human genome 3 and (b)\u00a0generating a separate prognosis for PD susceptibility developed by considering genetic variation 4 alongside family medical history, diet, exercise and medical history, and then communicating that prognosis to the subject\u2019s doctor. \n Or, to simplify even further, this is a patent on one particular method of predicting susceptibility to Parkinson\u2019s Disease. \n The Past and Future of 23andMe\u2019s Patent . \u00a0It is important to note that everything we\u2019ve said so far describes only the present state of this single patent as presently granted to 23andMe.\u00a0The company has indicated that it will \u201ccontinue to pursue patents that we believe will eventually benefit us all,\u201d but has not publicly expounded upon what, specifically, that might entail. \n As for 23andMe\u2019s first patent, the patent that was issued earlier this week is substantially narrower than the patent that the company sought 18 months ago, as we can see by comparing the claims section from 23andMe\u2019s published patent application (2011/0130337) to that of the issued patent (8,187,811) 5 . In particular, (i) the range of genetic variants covered by the patent has been narrowed, (ii) the claims on primers designed to specifically hybridize to the identified genetic variants have been removed completely and, likewise, (iii)\u00a0an attempted claim for \u201ca kit for diagnosis or prognosis of PD\u201d based on the identified genetic variants has vanished in its entirety. 6 \n Also gone is claim 10 of 23andMe\u2019s original application, which was clearly the application\u2019s most ambitious claim, and comprised \u201ca method for treating or preventing the development of PD\u201d by \u201cadministering to a subject suffering from or identified at risk for PD an agent that modulates expression or activity of a protein\u201d influenced by the one of the identified genetic variants. \n The fact that 23andMe\u2019s patent application was narrowed so significantly should come as no surprise. Despite persistent claims that the PTO\u2019s review process is inadequate to the task, producing questionable and/or overly broad patents (see, e.g., here and here ), it does result in the limiting (and even outright rejection) of numerous patent applications. \n Likely of particular interest to the PTO in reviewing (and ultimately narrowing) 23andMe\u2019s patent application, as co-founder Anne Wojcicki noted in her announcement of the company\u2019s own patent , is the ongoing question \u201cof whether innovations related to genetics can be patented,\u201d which Wojcicki acknowledged remains a \u201chot debate as evidenced by recent rulings related to Prometheus and Myriad patents.\u201d \n As background, this past July, in Association for Molecular Pathology v. USPTO (aka the Myriad gene patent litigation ), the Federal Circuit held unanimously 7 that Myriad Genetics\u2019 claims on a method to assess cancer susceptibility by examining genetic variations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were invalid . The court found that Myriad\u2019s claims \u201crecite nothing more than abstract mental steps necessary to compare two different nucleotide sequences\u201d and, therefore, do not constitute patentable subject matter. \n Next, in March of this year, the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion, also unanimously, in its opinion in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories , holding that Prometheus Laboratories\u2019 claims to methods of administering drugs to treat an autoimmune disease reflected a law of nature and did not constitute a patentable invention .\u00a0As Justice Breyer put it: \n If a law of nature is not patentable, then neither is a process reciting a law of nature, unless that process has additional features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself. A patent, for example, could not simply recite a law of nature and then add the instruction \u201capply the law.\u201d Einstein, we assume, could not have patented his famous law by claiming a process consisting of simply telling linear accelerator operators to refer to the law to determine how much energy an amount of mass has produced (or vice versa). Nor could Archimedes have secured a patent for his famous principle of flotation by claiming a process consisting of simply telling boat builders to refer to that principle in order to determine whether an object will float. \n Both the Myriad and Prometheus opinions discussed above were published subsequent to the filing of 23andMe\u2019s patent application in November 2010, and there should be little doubt that each played a role in the PTO\u2019s review and narrowing of the PD-related claims 23andMe initially sought. \n As for the future of 23andMe\u2019s current patent, there remains the possibility that its claims will be further limited, or even invalidated entirely, by way of one or more post-grant challenges to the breadth and validity of those claims. Last September, Congress passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (aka patent reform legislation) and, in the process, revised and expanded the options available to third parties to challenge patents following their issuance by the PTO . With relevant litigation still pending (for example, Myriad is currently awaiting additional review at the Federal Circuit level following its remand from the Supreme Court ) and the options for would-be challengers of 23andMe\u2019s patent bolstered by the recent patent reform legislation, the future of 23andMe\u2019s patent is far from secure. \n Of course, with the cost of challenging a patent, whether through the PTO or in court, typically starting at six figures and rising rapidly from there, whether any would-be challengers to 23andMe\u2019s patent actually emerge depends almost entirely on the answer to our third question. \n 3.\u00a0 How is 23andMe going to use its patent? Patents are frequently mischaracterized as granting the inventor sole ownership and control of the claimed invention.\u00a0In fact, patents provide a more limited right to exclude others from making, using or selling that invention .\u00a0As a practical matter, this means that many patents covering (or arguably covering) many \u201cinventions\u201d are never enforced, with actual and potential infringement of untold patents happening every minute of every hour of every day. \n The rubber meets the road when a patent holder\u00a0\u2014 or the assignee, purchaser or licensee of the patent\u00a0\u2014 seeks to prevent what it believes to be an infringing use of the covered invention, which can include suing or threatening to sue the alleged infringer.\u00a0Inventors profit financially from the patents they awarded primarily in one of two ways:\u00a0 either by (i) exercising their right to exclude others from using the invention (as Myriad Genetics has done in using its patents on breast cancer genes to develop a lucrative diagnostic product) or (ii) sharing that right with others in exchange for a fee (i.e., licensing). \n 23andMe, while arguably one of the most successful personal genomics companies in terms of consumer uptake and public exposure, is still a business struggling to find its way to profitability.\u00a0Co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki explicitly acknowledged as much in a note sent to customers in early May 8 to clarify yet another change in the company\u2019s pricing structure. \u201cWe are not profitable yet,\u201d Wojcicki wrote, \u201cand we need to continue to develop our business model.\u201d \n 23andMe has been working on achieving profitability for a while now, having raised more than $50 million in investor funding (in addition to the tens of millions contributed by Wojcicki, her husband, Google co-founder Sergey Brin , and others to Parkinson\u2019s Disease research with which 23andMe is involved, with some of those dollars flowing back to 23andMe) since the company was founded more than five years ago. \n Naturally, then, 23andMe is exploring all available avenues as it seeks to find a sustainable business model that will return, and ideally multiply, the money its investors have handed to it over the past half decade, including pursuing patents on the results of the research it conducts with the assistance of its customers. \n Still, the company\u2019s patent announcement prompted plenty of questions, in part because of the unmistakable tension in Wojcicki\u2019s statement between the company\u2019s need to demonstrate a commercially viable business model and its desire to provide the public with affordable, unfettered access to their genomes, at times seeming to vacillate between the two. \n \u201cIf the follow up work we are now doing with the Scripps Research Institute and the Michael J. Fox Foundation looks promising and moves towards drug development,\u201d Wojcicki wrote, \u201cthe patent will be important for a biotech or pharmaceutical company to pursue drug development.\u201d\u00a0In the very next sentence, however, Wojcicki emphasized that 23andMe believes \u201cpatents should not be used to obstruct research or prevent individuals from knowing what\u2019s in their genome.\u00a0We believe that everyone has a right to know their genomes \u2014 their sequence of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs \u2014 and should be able to access them should they want to.\u201d \n A diagnostic patent such as the one issued to 23andMe this week may one day be valuable to a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, although in all likelihood it would first need to be paired with other, stronger patents more directly applicable to a targeted and commercially protectable diagnostic or therapeutic product. But to the extent that 23andMe\u2019s first patent does one day come to represent a commercially valuable asset, as opposed to a scientifically important discovery or invention (depending on your point of view), its value is most likely to rest with its ability to help the party controlling the patent (whether 23andMe or a future pharmaceutical or biotechnology acquirer) prevent others from using the patent invention, in this case a method for predicting PD susceptibility. 9 \n That unavoidable tension helped to spur a flurry of concerned comments in response to 23andMe\u2019s patent announcement, including the following: 10 \n \n Why were we not explicitly told that 23andMe would be pursuing patents on research involving its customers? [ Holly Dunsworth ] \n \n 23andMe responded by pointing to sections of its terms of service and research consent document that referenced its \u201c intent to pursue intellectual property rights .\u201d The references in those documents to the company\u2019s commercial plans are vague and conditional, with the most explicit showing up in Section 5 of the 23andMe consent document , which states that \u201c if 23andMe develops intellectual property and/or commercializes products or services, directly or indirectly, based on the results of this study, you will not receive any compensation.\u201d (emphasis added) \n \n How does a patent on a method of determining susceptibility to Parkinson\u2019s Disease (i.e., a diagnostic patent) drive the development of a therapy? \u00a0[ Stuart Hogarth ] \n \n In response, 23andMe reiterated Wojcicki\u2019s original comment that \u201cif our continued research on SGK1 offers promise, the patent may be crucial for a pharmaceutical company to take the next step and begin drug development,\u201d which is arguably not much of a response. As mentioned above, the likelihood of the patent as issued being \u201ccrucial\u201d to the development of a PD therapy seems slender indeed, but recall that claim 10 of 23andMe\u2019s original patent application, which was explicitly therapeutic in nature, was not allowed by the PTO. \n \n If 23andMe\u2019s core beliefs include an individual\u2019s right to unfettered access to his or her own genetic data, why hasn\u2019t the company publicly committed to using and/or licensing its patent only in accordance with those beliefs? [E.g., Madeleine Ball , Stuart Hogarth , Dave Mackey and Carl Lumma ] \n \n In response, 23andMe reiterated its general philosophy regarding genetic access and patents, but stopped well short of publicly imposing restrictions on how it will use or permit others (including its sought after pharmaceutical or biotechnology partners) to use its patents. As Madeleine Ball notes , prominent technology developers, including Red Hat and Twitter have public policies limiting their enforcement of certain patents. In addition, fellow personal genomics company Navigenics has \u00a0long maintained a written policy promising to license on a non-exclusive, non-discriminatory basis any gene patents it may acquire (although Navigenics\u2019\u00a0own policy appears to explicitly exclude diagnostic patents of the type issued to 23andMe). \n In addition to the important questions above, here is one more: \n \n Why has 23andMe not been more aggressive in trying to engage its customer base as a partner in its for-profit endeavors? \n \n Rather than continuing the struggle to strike the elusive balance between encouraging individuals to freely give of their genomic and phenotypic data in the name of scientific progress and urging investors to open their wallets wide on the promise of future corporate profits, why not seek to align the two goals by finding a way for 23andMe\u2019s customers to share more directly in the company\u2019s success. As one example, last spring in the journal Science , Mitchell et al. \u00a0proposed a novel approach to genomic biobanking based on the trade secret model . After interviewing biobank volunteers, the authors concluded that many healthy participants already understand their participation (contributing genetic information, medical records and other data, answering surveys and questionnaires, etc.) in terms of an exchange, and some in explicitly financial terms. 23andMe could seek to invest their customers and research participants directly in the company\u2019s ongoing success by promising to share a (likely small) portion of the financial proceeds it realized from research and/or commercial partnerships built upon customer-provided data. \n While even a nominal sharing of corporate profits might be the most direct way to ease the tension between soliciting already-paying customers to provide additional data from which 23andMe seeks to profit, as Mitchell et al . note, \u201cthe trade-secret model does not require that an exchange take the form of money.\u201d In addition to sharing data with its participants and involving them in the identification of research targets, two things Mitchell and his colleagues suggest and 23andMe has already embraced, the company could take other steps to more clearly align its own interests with those of its customers, including joining the growing movement to promote expanded access to scientific research . Rather than embracing its\u00a0scorpion nature\u00a0and erecting walls around its data , it could embrace openness instead, and commit not only to publishing its own research in an open access format but to requiring its commercial partners to do the same as a condition to their receiving access to data supplied by 23andMe\u2019s customers. \n Taking a step back, it is hardly surprising that 23andMe appears to be unsure, at this point in time, as to how exactly it intends to use its newly issued patent. Given the continuing shifts in the company\u2019s business model and the company\u2019s uncertainty as to what value, if any, outside parties will place on the patent (or 23andMe\u2019s future patents) now or ever, 23andMe has a clear interest in keeping its options open.\u00a0It is also not surprising that the company is proud of earning its first patent, which represents an important and validating milestone for a young company. \n What is surprising is that 23andMe appears to lack a coordinated plan for positioning its patent\u00a0\u2014 a relatively pedestrian diagnostic method patent that, if it ever becomes valuable enough to be challenged, might not survive the challenge\u00a0\u2014 as clearly of secondary importance to what is, at least in this author\u2019s view, unquestionably the company\u2019s most valuable asset: an engaged, enthusiastic and growing community of customers-qua-research-participants who, provided 23andMe can keep from alienating too many of them, represent something much more unique, and inventive, than US Patent number 8,187,811. \n _______________ \n 1 23andMe\u2019s first provisional patent application was filed in late 2009, the same year it launched its PD initiative. Provisional patent applications are not examined by the PTO and, unlike patent applications, are not published. \n 2 In a comment on its blog post two days later , 23andMe did provide the patent number (8,187,811), although not a direct link. \n 3 The first genetic variant\u00a0\u2014 a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP\u00a0\u2014 is identified in claim 1 by its \u201crs\u201d or \u201c r eference S NP\u201d number 10513789; the other seven variants are identified in claim 5. \n 4 Only the first of the eight SNPs (rs10513789) was allowed in claim 6 (the method for generating a multi-factorial prognosis and communicating it to a subject\u2019s doctor), which represents a narrowing of what 23andMe sought in its original application. \n 5 Text in black represents overlap between the application and the issued patent.\u00a0Text that is blue and underlined represents new text in the issued patent that did not appear in the patent application. Text in red that has been struck through represents text from the patent application that does not appear in the issued patent. And text in green represents text from the patent application that appears in the issued patent but has been moved, with the strikethrough portion representing where that that text appeared in the application and the underlined portion represent where that text appears in the issued patent. \n 6 See claims 2 (related to rs11755699), 6-8 (related to primers) and 9 (related to a diagnostic kit) of the 23andMe patent application. \n 7 While the opinion was not unanimous in its entirety, on the question of the validity of Myriad\u2019s diagnostic method claims the panel held 3-0 that those claims were invalid. \n 8 The note was sent to customers on May 8, 2012, although for reasons unknown it has been given a publication date of January 8, 2012 on 23andMe\u2019s corporate blog and is available only to customers who are logged in to their accounts. A 23andMe representative clarified that the January 8, 2012 post represents a separate communication by the company, also regarding customer pricing models. \n 9 There are other ways in which 23andMe\u2019s patent could be valuable, including as a bargaining chip in future discussions to create patent pools or similar resources designed to prevent patents from impeding the development and provision of personalized medicine.\u00a0However, this is not an angle that 23andMe has emphasized, preferring instead to focus on the potential direct commercial value of its patent. \n 10 The questions are presented in a combined, condensed and paraphrased format for clarity, with a link provided to the original comment or post."], "link": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/06/01/patenting-and-personal-genomics-23andme-receives-its-first-patent-and-plenty-of-questions/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.uspto.gov/": 2, "http://www.navigenics.com/": 1, "http://spittoon.23andme.com/": 13, "http://blog.twitter.com/": 1, "http://del-fi.org/": 1, "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 11, "http://www.plosgenetics.org/": 1, "http://www.sciencemag.org/": 1, "https://twitter.com/": 1, "http://www.sughrue.com/": 1, "http://www.usconstitution.net/": 1, "http://www.crunchbase.com/": 1, "https://www.23andme.com/": 8, "http://www.ftc.gov/": 1, "http://www.madprime.org/": 3, "http://patft.uspto.gov/": 1, "http://access2research.org/": 1, "https://www.eff.org/": 1, "http://www.bloomberg.com/": 1, "http://genevalues.wordpress.com/": 2, "http://www.redhat.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Genomics Law Report"}, {"content": ["We recently covered the Ninth Circuit\u2019s split decision in Haskell v. Harris , 1 which found DNA Fingerprinting of arrestees pursuant to California\u2019s Prop 69 to be constitutionally sound. We also reported the Minnesota Supreme Court findings in In re Welfare of M.L.M. and State v. Johnson , rejecting challenges of DNA Fingerprinting based on 4th Amendment and Equal Protection grounds. \n An Update from Colorado. An ongoing prosecution, United States v. Fricosu, 2 became the most recent constitutional challenge to DNA fingerprinting upon arrest. The defendant, Ramona Fricosu, had her DNA sampled as part of her arrest pursuant to the DNA Fingerprinting Act of 2005, 42 U.S.C. \u00a714135(a). She filed a motion challenging the constitutionality of the practice, requesting that the court order her DNA sample and CODIS profile be destroyed. Fricosu challenged the constitutionality of the practice on Fourth Amendment grounds. On February 22, 2012, Colorado District Judge Blackburn denied the motion (pdf). \n Specifically, Judge Blackburn noted that only two federal appellate courts have considered the constitutionality of the DNA Fingerprinting Act as it applies to arrestees: the Ninth Circuit ruling of United States v. Pool 3 and the Third Circuit ruling of United States v. Mitchell . 4 As we noted previously , the Ninth Circuit opinion in United States v. Pool has no precedential value, the opinion having been vacated. Judge Blackburn followed the road map set out by the Third Circuit without any notable deviations. Like the Third Circuit, Judge Blackburn applied a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis and considered two separate searches: the DNA sampling and the subsequent creation of the CODIS profile. Quickly dismissing the first search as minimally invasive, Judge Blackburn\u2019s opinion focused on the nature of the second search. \n As has become commonplace in these opinions on DNA fingerprinting, the Judge focused on \u201cjunk DNA\u201d and what \u201cjunk DNA\u201d can tell us about \u201cphysical and medical characteristics.\u201d Judge Blackburn, agreeing with the Third Circuit, reasoned that there is a significant difference in the \u201camounts of private information\u201d included in a DNA sample and a CODIS profile, the latter of \u201cwhich at present reveals only identity.\u201d Judge Blackburn was not persuaded by the \u201cpotentially nefarious uses to which this information might be put,\u201d citing a lack of evidence that \u201csuch hypothetical abuses are either likely or imminent.\u201d Balancing the privacy interests against the government\u2019s legitimate interests in the information, Judge Blackburn found there are sufficient safeguards in the statutes that limit law enforcement uses of the DNA sample to identification purposes and that deter and penalize abuse of law enforcement discretion or misuse of the DNA profiles. \n Mitchell Not Moving on Up. On March 19, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court denied (pdf) the petition of certiorari in United States v. Mitchell , the Third Circuit opinion upon which the Colorado District Court relied in Fricosu the previous month. Justice Kagan did not take part in the consideration or decision. It seems likely that the Justices are content to let the constitutionality of DNA fingerprinting upon arrest percolate a while longer at the lower court level and will not grant certiorari unless a clear divide among the federal circuits becomes apparent. \n_______________________ \n 1 Haskell v.

Mayo originally bought and used Prometheus test kits that employed the patented method, but it then decided to sell and market its own test, which was similar, but not identical.\u00a0 Prometheus sued for patent infringement.\u00a0 The district court found that Mayo\u2019s test would infringe the Prometheus patents, but it then held the patents invalid as essentially claiming unpatentable laws of nature\u2013in this case, the relationship between the levels of the specified metabolite and the efficacy or toxicity of the relevant drugs. \n The Federal Circuit reversed this decision in 2009 , finding that the claims satisfied its then-controlling machine-or-transformation test.\u00a0 Both the administering and determining stages, the court held, brought about a transformation of the patient\u2019s body.\u00a0 In the summer of 2010, while a Prometheus cert. petition (a request for Supreme Court review) was pending, the Supreme Court decided Bilski v. Kappos , a case involving a patent on a method of commodities hedging.\u00a0 In a set of murky opinions, the Court held that the machine-or-transformation test was not the exclusive test of subject matter eligibility for method claims, but that\u00a0it could be helpful in appropriate cases.\u00a0 Immediately thereafter, the Court ordered the Federal Circuit to reconsider its Prometheus opinion in light of Bilski .\u00a0 In an opinion that might be described as perfunctory, the Federal Circuit held once more that the Prometheus patents comprised statutory subject matter , and the Supreme Court granted cert . \n The Supreme Court\u2019s Reasoning .\u00a0The Court\u2019s opinion \u00a0(pdf) focuses on the difference between claims to laws of nature themselves and claims to specific applications of such laws: the former fail the section 101 subject matter test, while the latter pass.\u00a0 The laws of nature involved here are the \u201crelationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a\u00a0\u00a0 thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm.\u201d\u00a0 The legal question then becomes, \u201cdo the patent claims add enough to their statements of the correlations to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws?\u201d\u00a0For all nine members of the Court, the answer was a clear no. \n The\u00a0Court\u2019s analysis of the claims went through four steps.\u00a0 First, it observed, the administering step just defines \u201cthe relevant audience\u201d\u2014doctors who treat patients with thiouprine drugs.\u00a0 Second, \u201cthe \u2018wherein\u2019 clauses simply tell a doctor about the relevant natural laws.\u201d\u00a0 Third, the determining step does not specify any particular process, but merely invites doctors \u201cto engage in well understood, routine, conventional activity.\u2019\u00a0 And fourth, \u201cto consider the three steps as an ordered combination adds nothing to the laws of nature that is not already present when the steps are considered separately.\u201d\u00a0 In sum, \u201cthe three steps simply tell doctors to gather data from which they may draw an inference in light of the correlation.\u201d\u00a0 They \u201care not sufficient to transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications of those regularities.\u201d\u00a0 To allow such a patent could \u201cinhibit further discovery by improperly tying up the future use of laws of nature.\u201d \n What Do We Learn?\u00a0 The first point is that section 101 is alive and well as the first test of patentability.\u00a0 Some recent Federal Circuit opinions have suggested that section 101 can and should be avoided in most cases , leaving the work of evaluating patents to sections 102 (novelty), 103 (nonobviousness), and 112 (written description).\u00a0 The Court explicitly rejects that approach, refusing to let section 101, with its law of nature prohibition, become \u201ca dead letter.\u201d\u00a0 So the Patent Office and the courts will continue to have to make an initial determination of whether an invention comprises statutory subject matter, independent of whether it satisfies the other criteria of patentability.\u00a0 Nonetheless, the language quoted above about \u201cwell understood, routine, conventional activity\u201d suggests that novelty and obviousness have some relevance to subject matter eligibility, despite loud protests that this conflates section 101 with issues presumably assigned to 102 and 103. \n Second, although this opinion is light years ahead of Bilski in terms of clarity, it is still hard to be absolutely certain of what the subject matter test for method patents is.\u00a0 We know\u2014from the last paragraph of the opinion\u2014that patents that \u201ceffectively claim the underlying laws of nature themselves\u201d are invalid.\u00a0 Another version of this is that a survivable claim must \u201cdiffer significantly from a claim that just said \u2018apply the algorithm.\u2019\u201d But just how to identify such a claim is a more difficult issue.\u00a0 We know that a claim structured just like Prometheus\u2019s is invalid: that is, a claim that involves nothing more than gathering data that may provoke an inference based on a law of nature (for example, maybe, the claims upheld by the Federal Circuit on August 31, 2011 in Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. v. Biogen IDEC ?).\u00a0 Some additional application of the law of nature is required\u2014but how much? \n The Court rejects \u201csimply appending conventional steps, specified at high level of generality, to laws of nature.\u201d\u00a0 It expresses particular concern about claims so broad as to \u201cseek pre-empt the use\u201d of the law of nature.\u00a0 But it gives little affirmative guidance about how specific the application of the law must be, declining to speculate on precisely what additional limitations might have saved the Prometheus claims before it. \n Impact on Myriad ?\u00a0 There have already been a lot of questions raised about the impact of Prometheus on the Myriad litigation , in which a cert petition is still pending in the Supreme Court.\u00a0 Does this new decision make it more or less likely that the Court will take Myriad? Does it suggest a likely outcome if the Court does take it? \n Before speculating about these questions, it is important to remember that the Federal Circuit decision in Myriad addressed three separate sets of patent claims: (1) the court upheld (with a partial dissent) Myriad\u2019s product claims on cDNA and isolated DNA; (2) the court also upheld Myriad\u2019s claims to methods of screening potential cancer therapeutics by analyzing growth rates of cells with altered BRCA genes in the presence or absence of the treatments; but (3) the court rejected Myriad\u2019s claims to methods of analyzing BRCA gene sequences and comparing those with cancer-predisposing mutations to normal sequences. The cert petitions filed by both sides do not address the methods claims (only the product claims and the highly technical standing issue), but the Supreme Court could order briefing and argument on any aspect of the case. \n The Prometheus decision says nothing about gene product claims, so is irrelevant to issue (1) in Myriad. But it says a lot, obviously, about method claims that bear at least some structural similarity to those in Prometheus .\u00a0 So does Prometheus indicate that the Court is more or less likely to review those method claims? (Warning: anyone who claims to have inside information about pending Supreme Court decisions is lying\u2014Court security makes the old KGB look like a sieve.) Our guess (and it\u2019s little more than that) is that the issuance of Prometheus makes it less likely that the Court would review the Myriad method claims.\u00a0 It has just issued a unanimous and\u2014by the standards of Supreme Court patent cases\u2014relatively clear opinion on generally similar medical methods.\u00a0 History suggests that is unlikely to want to revisit that topic the very next year.\u00a0 Prometheus itself is an obvious exception, of course, coming right after Bilski. But the Court may have realized how unhelpful its fractured Bilski opinion was, and all of the justices apparently believed that the Federal Circuit had either failed to understand it or chosen to ignore it.\u00a0 And the history of Prometheus suggests a possible pathway for Myriad: that the Supreme Court would grant cert, but (with respect to the method claims) for the limited purpose of vacating the Federal Circuit\u2019s opinion and ordering reconsideration in light of Prometheus. \n But if the Court does decide to review Myriad (or if the Federal Circuit is ordered to do it over) , does Prometheus help us to predict the outcome?\u00a0 The method claims that the Federal Circuit rejected ((3) above) are hard to distinguish from those in Prometheus : doctors gather information and make a straightforward comparison, using basic genetic knowledge.\u00a0 Those claims are likely to be rejected once again.\u00a0 The drug-screening claims that were upheld ((2) above) are a closer call.\u00a0 If the \u201calgorithm\u201d is the protocol for comparing the effects of treating or not treating cell lines, then \u201cdo the patent claims add enough to their statements of the correlations [or algorithm] to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws?\u201d\u00a0 There is a good bit of practical application going on here: cell lines must be grown and drugs applied (or not) before a judgment is made.\u00a0 It looks more like a real-world pharmaceutical process than a broad statement of an algorithm.\u00a0 For that reason, it seems more likely than not that this category of method claims would be upheld once again under section 101. \n Conclusion . We now know considerably more about the Supreme Court\u2019s views on methods than we did after the worse-than-useless Bilski opinion.\u00a0 It is refreshing to these observers that the Court dove right back into method patents in an apparent effort to rectify the damage it did in Bilski (and there\u2019s also some entertainment value in the revival of the Supreme Court-Federal Circuit tension that seemed to have abated a bit). But it also seems unlikely that the Court would go back to the method issue immediately, so we doubt that it will take that part of Myriad, except for the limited purpose of remanding to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. \n In terms of impact on the marketplace, there is, of course, serious impact if your business model depends on patents just like these (e.g., if you are Dr. Classen).\u00a0 But for others, both in biotechnology and IT, the effect should be minimal.\u00a0 Admittedly, the mere changing of the test from one that was formerly more inclusive to one that narrows eligibility is potentially destabilizing\u2013under the former machine-or-transformation test, \u201cadministering\u201d and \u201cdetermining\u201d steps were generally transformative and therefore corresponded with patent eligibility.\u00a0 But the key word is potentially , since the Prometheus patents already reflected an extreme stretching of section 101\u2019s limits, and were also\u2014as the Federal Circuit pointed out in its 2009 opinion\u2014highly suspect under sections 102 and 103."], "link": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/03/21/prometheus-patents-struck-down-9-0-mayo-collaborative-services-v-prometheus-laboratories-inc-analysis/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.ipwatchdog.com/": 1, "http://www.supremecourt.gov/": 2, "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 13}, "blogtitle": "Genomics Law Report"}, {"content": ["SD H.B. 1260, introduced in South Dakota on January 26, 2012, is an act that would govern the use of genetic information.

In under 200 words, the South Dakota bill, if passed, would (1) grant property rights to individuals in their DNA samples and genetic information, (2) prohibit surreptitious testing, (3) call into question many forensic and law enforcement uses of DNA, (4) eliminate newborn blood spot screening without explicit consent and (5) impose broadly worded informed consent requirements on all collections and uses of individual genetic data.

While the importance of securing informed consent for the full range of uses of personal genetic data is unarguable, as we have written previously , state-level attempts to define the informed consent process may be disruptive to research and public health efforts, particularly those spanning multiple states, as potential vertical and horizontal conflicts put investigators (academic researchers and those in the personal genomics industry) in a bind. \n As just one example, the South Dakota\u2019s bill requirement that no genetic data or DNA be \u201csold or given to any federal or state agency, any data bank for storage, or be used for research unless the person gives written informed consent after the test and use of the results is specifically explained\u201d could easily call into question the use of broad consenting approaches that are crucial to large-scale and longitudinal genetic and genomic research. (SD H.B. 1260, Lines 13-15) \n Parsing Proposals to Create Property Rights in DNA. Whatever its ultimate fate, South Dakota\u2019s proposal shares at its core a theme that we have highlighted across numerous posts here at the Genomics Law Report , including similar proposals from Vermont , Massachusetts , and Alabama : the desire to confer greater individual rights in and control over genetic data. With that in mind, we offer a line-by-line comparison of how several proposed state statutes would purport to confer ownership rights to individuals over their genetic material and information. \n On to the states (emphasis is ours unless otherwise noted): \n 1. South Dakota ( SD H.B. 1260 ) \n \u201cAll DNA, genetic information, or results of any genetic test\u2026are the sole property of the person from whom it was derived \u2026\u201d (SD H.B. 1260, Lines 9-11) \n 2. Alabama ( AL H. 78 ) \n \u201cGENETIC INFORMATION\u2026is also the personal property of whom it is taken .\u201d (Page 2, Lines 22-27; Page 3, Lines 1-4) \n 3. Massachusetts ( MA S.B. 1080 ) \n \u201c\u2026it shall be a goal of the Commonwealth to declare genetic information the excusive property of the individual from whom the information is obtained . (MA S.B.1080, Lines 5-6) \n \u201cGenetic material shall be considered real property subject to one\u2019s individual control and dominion in accord with generally held precepts of property law in the Commonwealth.\u201d (MA S.B.1080, Lines 64-65) \n 4. Vermont ( VT H. 368 ) \n \u201c\u2026it is the intent of the general assembly to declare genetic information the exclusive property of the individual from whom the information is obtained .\u201d (VT H.368, Lines 15-17). \n \u201c\u2026genetic material shall be considered real property subject to one\u2019s individual control and dominion in accordance with generally held precepts of property law in Vermont\u2026\u201d (VT H.368, Lines 8-11) \n When reviewing the state proposals, it is important to keep an eye on both clauses, the type of property (indicated by single underlines) and upon whom the property rights are conferred (indicated by italics). \n Many of these phrases are legal terms of art, with distinct legal meanings that are often not in line with common usage. Take note of the following Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed) definitions: \n \u2022 Real Property : \u201cLand and anything growing on, attached to, or erected on it, excluding anything that may be severed without injury to the land.\u201d \n \u2022 Personal Property : \u201cAny movable or intangible thing that is subject to ownership and not classified as real property.\u201d \n \u2022 Private Property : \u201cProperty \u2013 protected from public appropriation \u2013 over which the owner has exclusive and absolute rights\u201d \n \u2022 Tangible Property : \u201cProperty that has physical form and characteristics.\u201d \n \u2022 Corporeal Property : \u201c1. The right of ownership in material things. 2. Property that can be perceived, as opposed to incorporeal property.\u201d \n \u2022 Qualified Property : \u201cA temporary or special interest in a thing (such as a right to possess it), subject to being totally extinguished by the occurrence of a specified contingency over which the qualified owner has no control.\u201d \n Lawyers love their fine distinctions, which means here that the specific terms that legislators use in crafting genetics rights bills can carry important distinctions. For instance, bills purporting to grant \u201creal property\u201d rights (Massachusetts and Vermont) to genetic material and information, should they pass, would potentially create an awkward blurring of the lines between real property and personal property, which carry many differences, including how such rights may be enforced or transferred to others. It may be that legislators are attempting to confer the same ownership and possessory rights to DNA samples that are afforded to land because casting genetic rights as \u201creal property\u201d would subject any transfers (e.g. sales, bequests, licenses) of DNA samples to the same requirements as land (e.g. transfers of land are unenforceable unless supported by a writing sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds ). \n Much more importantly, recognition of property rights of any manner in biospecimens and genetic information could vastly change the legal landscape and potentially abrogate the ruling in Moore v. Regents of the University of California , 793 P.2d 479 (Cal. 1990), the landmark California Supreme Court case that rejected John Moore\u2019s claim of property rights in his blood, cells and other biospecimens. In Moore , the court ruled that an individual had no property rights in his cells or other unique products of his body, and thus could not share in the commercial profits generated as the result of research performed on using Moore\u2019s biospecimens. An important rationale underpinning the California Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion was the potentially chilling effect imbuing biospecimens with property rights might have on medical and scientific research. State statutes explicitly creating property rights in individuals\u2019 DNA could put the result in Moore back under the microscope which, while potentially a welcome development for many individuals, could also create significant uncertainty for scientific and medical researchers, particularly those involved in ongoing research. \n Similarly, it is unclear whether acknowledging property rights in genetic material and information would potentially renew or bolster legal arguments challenging the constitutionality of DNA fingerprinting upon arrest (as opposed to following conviction), as recognition of property rights could, by extension, create an argument that DNA Fingerprinting upon arrest constitutes an unlawful taking in violation of the Due Process clauses found in the 5th and 14th Amendments. \n Similarly, as to the person or persons upon whom property rights (i.e., ownership and possession rights) are conferred by these proposed legislations, it is important to recognize narrow distinctions in phraseology. The clauses, \u201cfrom whom the information is obtained\u201d and \u201cfrom whom the information has been derived,\u201d are not likely to be construed similarly. The former is potentially much broader than the latter, particularly in a personal genomics and participatory research age. \u201cFrom whom the information is obtained\u201d could permit property rights to be extended to third parties not limited to relatives who share genetic information by virtue of shared ancestry. For example, if Annette shares her genomic information from 23andMe with her buddy Svend, and then Svend sells Annette\u2019s genomic information along with his own to his friend Natalie, it follows that Natalie \u201cobtained\u201d Annette\u2019s information from Svend, therefore Svend may be statutorily recognized (purposefully or perhaps unwittingly) as having property rights in Annette\u2019s genomic information such that he could lawfully transfer or license the information to Natalie at his unlimited discretion. Conversely, \u201cfrom whom the information has been derived\u201d seems to be less generous, conferring property rights only on the individual who submits a DNA sample for analysis. In the previous example this would imply that Svend would have property rights sufficient to sell his own information to Natalie but not Annette\u2019s information. \n Of course, none of the discussion above should be taken to suggest that conferring property rights in individuals is a bad thing. However, as this discussion should make painfully obvious, it is certainly not a simple thing. While legislators should be applauded for drafting two-page statutes, they should also be mindful of the complexity and the potential implications of their proposals. With all due respect to the South Dakotan legislature \u2013 a body with 70 members and only 35 working days this year \u2013 the importance of defining a new set of legal rights for a new era of personal genomics, and the challenges inherent in doing so, is yet another reminder of the importance of securing clear federal and international leadership ."], "link": "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/index.php/2012/03/20/on-genetic-rights-and-states-a-look-at-south-dakota-and-around-the-u-s/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://legis.sd.us/": 3, "http://alisondb.al.us/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2, "http://www.genomicslawreport.com/": 9}, "blogtitle": "Genomics Law Report"}]
