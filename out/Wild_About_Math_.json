[{"blogurl": "http://wildaboutmath.com\n", "blogroll": [], "title": "Wild About Math!"}, {"content": ["The MAA recently published a book, Mathematics Galore!, of creative classroom activities by James Tanton. These activities are great explorations for high school and motivated middle school students to work through alone, or for group work in Math Circles. I got a review copy of the book and instantly fell in love with it. I've been a fan of James' for some time, and I've plugged his work a number of times . \n When \"Mathematics Galore\" was published I used the event as an opportunity to congratulate James and as an excuse to interview James for my \"Inspired by Math\" podcast series . \n If you've been as enthralled as I've been by James' Youtube videos, or as impressed as I've been with his textbooks, you'll enjoy listening to this interview and getting to know James a little bit more personally. \n \n \n About James Tanton \n Believing that mathematics really is accessible to all, James Tanton (PhD, Mathematics, Princeton 1994) is committed to sharing the delight and the beauty of the subject. In 2004 James founded the St. Mark\u2019s Institute of Mathematics, an outreach program promoting joyful and effective mathematics education. He worked as a full-time high school teacher at St. Mark\u2019s School in Southborough MA,(2004-2012) and he conducted, and continues to conduct, mathematics graduate courses for teachers through Northeastern University and American University. He also gives professional development workshops across the nation and Canada. \n James recently relocated to Washington D.C. and is currently a visiting scholar of the Mathematical Association of America. He also conducts the professional development program for Math For America program in D.C. \n James is the author of SOLVE THIS: MATH ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS AND CLUBS (MAA, 2001), THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MATHEMATICS (Facts on File, 2005), MATHEMATICS GALORE! (MAA, 2012) and twelve self-published texts. He is the 2005 recipient of the Beckenbach Book Prize, the 2006 recipient of the Kidder Faculty Prize at St. Mark\u2019s School, and a 2010 recipient of a Raytheon Math Hero Award for excellence in school teaching. \n He also publishes research and expository articles, and through his extracurricular research classes for students has helped high school students pursue research projects and also publish their results. \n James Tanton's Coordinates \n Web-site: jamestanton.com \nYoutube channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/drjamestanton \nFacebook page: http://www.facebook.com/tanton.math \nTwitter feed: https://twitter.com/jamestanton \n About \"Mathematics Galore\" \n  \n Mathematics Galore! showcases some of the best activities and student outcomes of the St. Mark's Institute of Mathematics and invites you to engage in the mathematics yourself!

I had the opportunity recently to attend a private screening of the film. The documentary does an outstanding job of identifying a number of the issues that make the American math education system seriously challenged. Many of these were new to me. More importantly, this is not a \"doom and gloom\" film. Scott and Jen offer hope for our future and not in some abstract or hypothetical way. Scott has spent years as a classroom teacher. He's engaged students in amazing ways, through exciting and sophisticated role playing games. He and Jen have taken the powerful idea of role playing to develop Ko's Journey, a rite-of-passage math education game. (I interviewed the two for my podcast series.) These two are really onto something. \n Check out this trailer for \"The Biggest Story Problem.\" \n \n If you feel as inspired as I do please contribute to the goal of getting a copy of the film into every public middle school in the U.S. Be part of spreading this important message.

She is member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the Association of Women in Science (AWIS), and the Association for Women in Mathematics,(AWM). \n In addition to her research, Dr. Musielak is an enthusiastic promoter of the history of women in mathematics and gives talks to inspire young women. Musielak is also the author of Kuxan Suum: Path to the Center of the Universe, an unusual popular science book combining topics from astrophysics and astronautics. She is currently studying the history of mathematics, focusing on the 17th and 18th centuries. \n About Sophie's Diary \n Sophie\u2019s Diary: A Mathematical Novel is a work of fiction inspired by French mathematician Sophie Germain. It chronicles the coming of age of a teenager learning mathematics on her own, growing up during the most turbulent years of the French Revolution. The fictionalized diary uses mathematics, intertwined with historically-accurate accounts of the social chaos that reigned in Paris between 1789 and 1794, to describe the learning journey of a remarkable girl that became the first and only woman in history to make a substantial contribution to the proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. \n Sophie Germain was born in Paris in 1776. Little is known about her childhood or about her initiation into mathematics. Her first biographers wrote that, as a young woman, she assumed the name of a male student at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique to submit her own work to Lagrange. Yet, no biography has explained how Germain studied mathematics before that time to encourage such boldness. Sophie\u2019s Diary is an attempt to put in perspective how a self-taught girl could have acquired the knowledge to enter the world of Lagrange\u2019s analysis."], "link": "http://wildaboutmath.com/2012/08/19/dora-musielak-inspired-by-math-10/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.maa.org/": 1, "https://sites.google.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Wild About Math!"}, {"content": ["About the Flatland Movies \n The official website for Flatland the Movie is here . \n The Sphereland site is here . \n The facebook coordinates are here and their twitter link is here . \n About Seth Caplan - Producer \n Seth Caplan is an award winning filmmaker who has produced an acclaimed collection of feature films, animated movies, and documentary programs.

What is it about the subject that excites us yet sends a chilling tingle down our spine at the same time? How can it be so precise, yet so fickle? We may never know the answers to these questions, but we do know that math is ubiquitous, though some of us may try to hide from it. \n We also know that there are those who thrive off the subject, who can\u2019t get enough of it. PUP Executive Editor Vickie Kearn is one of those people. After all, since 2001, her job here at the Press has been acquiring the best titles in mathematics \u2013 and even before she came to PUP, she spent her whole life surrounded by numbers and equations. While math may sometimes cause us to cry tears of despair, it has caused Vickie to cry tears of joy. Her love of math started as a natural childhood talent, became a pleasantly surprising college benefit, and eventually grew into a career \u2013 one that she has dedicated to making the pursuit of mathematical knowledge easier and more enjoyable. \n As part of our continuing series of Q&As with our Science and Reference Editors for Princeton Global Science, we found out more about Vickie\u2019s publishing and math background.
