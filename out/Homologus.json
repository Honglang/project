The most common way is to download published programs (assemblers, aligners, etc.) , learn about its parameters and command line options, and run them on your data set. Second way is to understand the inner working of the programs and adjust your data to optimize the run. Third way is to start from algorithms instead of programs, write your own code and analyze the data. \n Most people use the first method, because it is the only way to process many different data sets in a \u2018core facility\u2019 mode. An example of second way is digital normalization approach developed by Titus Brown\u2019s group . In this method, one typically uses Velvet or other commonly used assemblers, but libraries are reduced in size to remove redundancy. The third method ( writing an assembler like SPAdes ) is considered \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019 by some and \u2018bread and butter\u2019 by others. Surely it is the best way to get the most out of data, and in some cases the only way to solve challenging problems (such as single-cell assembly addressed by SPAdes). \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n If you follow the third way above, there are three steps in writing a good program. The first step is to implement the algorithm in a scripting language like PERL/python and make it work on a very small data set. In this step, you are essentially making sure that your implementation of algorithm works, and do not care about efficiency gained through optimal use of hardware. \n In the second step, the same program is ported in C/C++ by using data structures from standard libraries. At the end of this step, you have the exact replica of your program in the low level language of your choice. \n In the third step, we go through every function and data structure of the above program and try to make sure they are optimally designed. It is very difficult work and needs good understanding of underlying hardware ( (processors, memory, cache structure, hard drive, etc.). In the following post, we will present an excellent example from stackoverflow that can be used for bioinformatics. \n One advantage of using three steps mentioned above is that even if you cannot optimize all stages of the program, you can be sure it works. The worst program is the one that does not run at all. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \n There are three ways to let the community know about your discoveries. First way is to use the old practice to keep sending papers to various journals and get rejected for minor technicalities. Second was is to post your preprint in arxiv.org, discuss results in your blog and argue with journals in parallel. Third way is to publish your original papers in the blog and send the journals packing. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 \n There are three ways to do biology these days. \n First way \u2013 you can continue to do \u2018one gene at a time\u2019 analysis using small-scale lab work. \n Second way \u2013 you can scale up the same with large-scale techniques (microarray, high-throughput sequencing, etc.) and publish one hundred unusual genes at a time without realizing that noise also scaled up . \n Third way is to understand that large-scale experiments are different beasts and need to be analyzed properly. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \n Finally, there are three ways to deal with US election.

That defies common sense, but common sense is considered a negative to judge who gets Nobel prize in economics (and peace as well ). \n To understand the fallacy in Krugman\u2019s argument, one needs to start with Bastiat\u2019s parable of the broken window . \n Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper, James Goodfellow, when his careless son has happened to break a pane of glass? If you have been present at such a scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty of them, by common consent apparently, offered the unfortunate owner this invariable consolation\u2014\u201dIt is an ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were never broken?\u201d \n Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, which it will be well to show up in this simple case, seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical institutions. \n Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier\u2019s trade\u2014that it encourages that trade to the amount of six francs\u2014I grant it; I have not a word to say against it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that which is seen. \n But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the encouragement of industry in general will be the result of it, you will oblige me to call out, \u201cStop there! Your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen.\u201d \n It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way, which this accident has prevented. \n \n For good laugh, you can also find what Krugman thinks about the broken window fallacy at this link . \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n P. S. When we wrote this article, we did not expect anyone to be stupid enough to suggest that the storm would be beneficial for the economy. Apparently, we overestimated the intelligence levels of economists from academia (hat tip Mish ). \n Economists say some of the impact caused by businesses closing will be offset by reconstruction efforts, and point to catastrophic storms like Katrina, which devastated New Orleans but did not deal lasting damage to the national economy. \n Peter Morici at the University of Maryland estimates that Sandy will cause about $35 billion to $45 billion in losses and damages but then be followed by as much as $36 billion in recovery spending. \n  \n Here is an interesting find that may explain the above comment from Peter Morici - \n Morici is noted for wearing bow ties.

The study is published in Cell . \n \nAlmost all global expression analysis involves isolation of RNA \nfrom two or more cellular sources, introducing similar amounts \nof RNA from the sources into the experimental platform and \nanalyzing the data by using algorithms that normalize the signal \nfrom the samples. If the cellular sources \nproduce equivalent amounts of RNA/cell, and the yields of \nRNA and its derivatives are equivalent throughout experimental \nmanipulation, then normalized expression data should produce \nan accurate representation of the relative levels of each gene \nproduct. \n We recently found that cells with high levels of c-Myc can \namplify their gene expression program, producing two to three \ntimes more total RNA and generating cells that are larger than \ntheir low-Myc counterparts. This discovery has led us to question the common assumption that cells produce similar levels of RNA/cell and the general practice of introducing similar amounts of total RNA into analysis platforms without including standardized controls that would \nreveal transcriptional amplification or repression. As described \nbelow, it is likely that this assumption and practice has led to \nerroneous interpretations. \n Here is more from the author of the study - \n Researchers led by Richard Young at the Whitehead Institute for Biological Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found that aggressive cancer cells produce several times more RNA than other cells. Moreover, three different commonly used methods for gene expression analysis\u2014DNA microarrays, RNA sequencing, and digital molecular barcoding\u2014masked these differences. \n \u201cWe then realized that the common assumption that cells contain similar levels of mRNA is badly flawed and can lead to serious misinterpretations,\u201d Jakob Lov\u00e9n, a postdoc in Young\u2019s lab, said in a press release.

In that thread, readers Dogface Macgee and Joey left thoughtful comments that cleared up some of our confusion about GPL. We already incorporated Dogface Macgee\u2019s comment in the previous thread. Here is Joey\u2019s comment - \n Just another step past what dogface has said, the grad student has the copyright. He can release it as GPL, make updates to the code, and sell it for millions of dollars and never release the code. Only the code originally released as GPL is considered GPL. If he is hired by a company and wants to use that in their products, he can. He has to give a different license to the company, which he absolutely can, as the copyright holder. It does get trickier when you use other libraries and tools, but it\u2019s not automatic. \n If you hold the copyright, this could make you more valuable as they would have to hire you or purchase from you another licensing set-up if they wanted to avoid the GPL. \n A detailed analysis must be done, but many GPL libraries can be considered as a \u201cSystem Library\u201d and if you use that then your code does not have to be GPL from the use of that library(others not so much). \n GPL is also a license between the user and the copyright holder, you do not have to release any of your code publicly, ever. You can sell it and then you must provide it to them, and they may provide it for free to the world. This won\u2019t work well except for very common systems, as there are millions of GPL programs out there with no support that no one uses (and no one is charging for). You can also charge a fee for the source code not exceeding the original fee of the binaries, however the downstream users may provide it to the world. \n Just wanted to clear up some misconceptions. I\u2019m not a fan of GPL myself and will avoid libraries and components(although separate components where you are only acting on the output are fine and don\u2019t \u2018gpl-infect\u2019). I much prefer BSD but can see some situations where a GPL code would be preferred. \n We researched the \u2018systems library\u2019 concept he mentioned, and believe it is covered under GPL linking exception . \n \nA GPL linking exception modifies the GNU General Public License (GPL) to create a new, modified license. Such modified licenses enable software projects which provide library code, to be \u201clinked to\u201d the programs that use them, without applying the full terms of the GPL to the using program. Linking is the technical process of connecting code in a library to the using code, to produce a single executable file. It is performed either at compile time or run-time in order to produce functional machine-readable code. There is a public perception, unsupported by any legal precedent or citation, that without applying the linking exception, code linked with GPL code may only be done using a GPL-compatible license.[1] The license of the GNU Classpath project explicitly includes a statement to that effect. \n Many free software libraries which are distributed under the GPL use an equivalent exception, although the wording of the exception varies. Notable projects include GNU Guile,[2] the run-time libraries of GNAT,[2] GNU Classpath [3] and the famous GCC Runtime Library Exception.[4] \nCompiler runtime libraries also often use this license, e.g. the libgcc library in the GNU Compiler Collection uses a very similar linking exception,[5] as well as all libraries of the Free Pascal project. \n In 2007, Sun Microsystems released most of the source code to the class libraries for the Java SE and Java EE projects under version 2 of the GPL license plus the Classpath linking exception,[6] and used the same license as one possible license for their enterprise server GlassFish.[7] and for their NetBeans Java IDE.[8] \n Version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)[9] is likewise constructed as an exception to the GPL.[10]\n \n Please feel free to add what you know about GPL, MIT license and other open-source options. \n P. S. Here is the master source that answers every question about GPL. It is the GPL FAQ from GNU."], "link": "http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2012/10/26/more-on-gpl-licensing-of-bioinformatics-programs/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.homolog.us/blog": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://www.gnu.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Homologus"}, {"content": ["From yahoo finance: \n Total Cash : 137M \n Total cash/share : 2.46 \n Book value: 2.66 \n Why is stock price below book value or cash/share? \n \n Full Time Employees: \t326 \n If the company spends $200K/employee/year, that is a cash burn of $65M/year.
