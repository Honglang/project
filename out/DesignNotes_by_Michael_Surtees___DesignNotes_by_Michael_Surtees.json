Last Xmas I got back to building with Lego. At the time I spent 2 days building the Lego Volkswagen T1 Camper Van. The time really flew by. Part of it was organizing the elements and putting them together. It was also hard to deny getting back to my youth when I would spend days putting structure together with lego and wood blocks. \n As I was building the VW Van, I would take shots to remember the progress. I really enjoyed viewing the progress and seeing the underlying structure. Every couple of hours significant progress would be made. Fast forward to now and I\u2019m just followed the same process building Fallingwater. The biggest difference between the two builds for me was I spent a lot less time organizing the bricks. For the VW I spent hours organizing the bricks by color and size. For Fallingwater I just dumped everything before starting with the instructions. \n Below I\u2019ve posted some of the pics that I shot for both the VW and Fallingwater.

The format was slightly different in that there was an emphasis to have the audience participate as much as the presenter. Below are my slides for how I\u2019ve turned serendipity into predictable patterns of inspiration. For my talk I shared a number of photo projects that built upon and influenced each other as the years progressed. From there I looked at three well known daily projects online discussing some of the common traits between them. The talk lasted about 75 minutes. For the last 20 minutes I asked the audience to go walk outside with their smart phone. Their project was to set an arbitrary measurement for taking photos. I gave the example of going outside and shoot what was in front of them every 30 seconds. The discussion afterwards allowed people to share their unexpected patterns of what they saw. By having them go through the exercise I was hoping it would be a starting point for other projects they might want to do on a daily basis.

With that said I keep an eye out on unexpected photo sharing connections. They might not be easy to replicate with technology or aggregating socially but could potentially get there with a small upgrade when it becomes a natural action with their iPhone. Case in point, there was a fire in DUMBO and two people that I follow on Instagram shot the same thing from their different locations and uploaded it roughly at the same time. I found it fascinating to see the same action caught from two distinct POV\u2019s. Each image gave a piece of info that the other couldn\u2019t. While the fire wasn\u2019t something that was going to change my day, seeing both of those images in my stream connected gave me something to pay attention to that I would have ignored otherwise if I had seen that smoke with my own eyes. \n UPDATE (4.24pm 7.14.2012) \n  \n Ironically a couple hours after this post, a 3 alarm fire happened in NYC across the waterway.

July is one of my favourite months because the Tour de France shows the best of teams, individuals and strategic dynamics of a sport like no other for an entire month. This year might be the first when I\u2019ve finally understood how points are won and time is saved. While I don\u2019t have a favorite racer or team I thought it would be interesting to look at some of the trends and special features of a couple teams sites. \n SKY PROCYCLING \n  \n Overall I think team Sky has the best site for those interested in getting up to date Tour de France news on the team. Within seconds a viewer can get news highlights of the days stage, photos and videos in an easy to identify way. They keep the site up to date with their posts and make it easy to find archived items. In terms of typography they\u2019ve balanced the headlines and body text simply with Verdana but added a bit of punch with their titles using a font called Cafeta . On their right rail, I really like how they\u2019ve integrated a Spotify playlist though all songs do not play in the US. The only thing missing is a Twitter feed of the riders participating in the race or a feed of the images that the racers are taking. \n \n RADIOSHACK-NISSAN \n  \n There isn\u2019t a huge difference in terms of easy to find info with Team RadioShack-Nissan\u2019s site to Team Sky\u2019s. I would have liked to see more posts on the home screen to balance out the right rail modules. The density of info is a bit much for the first time viewer but can easily navigate their way once they\u2019re familiar with the site. Unlike Team Sky, they do integrate a standard Twitter feed. While helpful to see who is saying what, the actually content from the tweets is minimized which makes it less useful. Typography wise, they\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about the hiearchy using different weights and sizes including Matrix, Engschrift and Lucida. While they have large image galleries, the UI for the player is pretty poor. Half the time the buttons to advance the images was missing. Overall it\u2019s a strong site design wise, though a bit predictable with no real technical surprises. \n \n MOVISTAR TEAM \n  \n Technically in terms of detailed small extras, Moviestar team excelled. I really liked seeing the number of wins they\u2019ve had, the km biked and how they integrated media types together. I was able to listen to after race commentary with the ability to download the audio file if wanted. I\u2019m not sure how many times I would do that but it shows that they\u2019re thinking much harder than the typical video and photo galleries that the other sites showed. They\u2019ve also got their own custom font called Moviestar. I think it works really well for display purposes but feels pretty heavy for body copy. With that said I like how they\u2019re looking at all the details. The home screen falls a part a bit as it\u2019s essentially a bunch of modules. While not hard to find up to date news by clicking on the news section, I think they should have brought more headlines to the first page. Overall this site has a decent amount of creativity that the other sites missed out on. \n \n BMC RACING TEAM \n \n I think the aesthetic heaviness of the site threw me off. Ignoring that big issue the site is practical as it is simple. It\u2019s pretty easy to find the latest news on the racers. Unfortunately they don\u2019t update the site after each stage. That inconsistency might throw a person off to wanting to come back over time. They too have audio podcasts but don\u2019t take the experience as far as Moviestar. \n \n GARMIN-SHARP \n  \nIn terms of layers, Garmin-Sharp makes scrolling a lot easier than the multiple layers that Moviestar has on the homescreen. Unfortunately a lot of those additional modules are for merchandise as opposed to helpful content. With that said the large images really add a lot of impact compared to the smaller thumbnails from the other team sites. They\u2019ve also got a pretty decent article detail page with lots of thumbnail images. It would have been nice to have a gallery view inside the rail though they made the choice to go full screen with images and give the ability to advance images that way. It\u2019s a pretty decent solution. My biggest confusion is the url: www.slipstreamsports.com , I\u2019m not sure how that relates to the team name. \n \n Other Teams \nBelow are the other team sites to compare with the sites that I thought were worth taking note of. \n OMEGA PHARMA-QUICK STEP \n LIQUIGAS-CANNONDALE \n KATUSHA TEAM \n ASTANA PRO TEAM \n AG2R LA MONDIALE \n FDJ-BIGMAT \n COFIDIS LE CREDIT EN LIGNE \n TEAM EUROPCAR \n LOTTO-BELISOL TEAM \n VACANSOLEIL-DCM \n EUSKALTEL \u2013 EUSKADI \n SAUR-SOJASUN \n TEAM SAXO BANK-TINKOFF BANK \n RABOBANK CYCLING TEAM \n LAMPRE \u2013 ISD \n ORICA GREENEDGE \n TEAM ARGOS-SHIMANO"], "link": "http://designnotes.info/?p=7270", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.slipstreamsports.com/": 3, "http://www.1t4i.com/": 1, "http://www.greenedgecycling.com/": 1, "http://en.teameuropcar.com/": 1, "http://www.teamliquigascannondale.com/": 1, "http://www.vacansoleildcm.com/": 1, "http://www.equipecyclistefdj.fr/": 1, "http://www.rabosport.com/": 1, "http://www.proteam-astana.com/": 1, "http://www.azfonts.net/": 1, "http://www.radioshacknissantrek.com/": 2, "http://www.movistarteam.com/": 2, "http://www.ag2rlamondiale.fr/": 1, "http://www.lottobelisol.be/": 1, "http://www.bmcracingteam.com/": 2, "http://www.katushateam.com/": 1, "http://www.equipe-cofidis.com/": 1, "http://www.teamsky.com/": 2, "http://team-euskaltel.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.saur-sojasun.com/": 1, "http://www.teamsaxobanktinkoffbank.com/": 1, "http://www.omegapharma-quickstep.com/": 1, "http://www.teamlampre.it/": 1}, "blogtitle": "DesignNotes by Michael Surtees | DesignNotes by Michael Surtees"}, {"content": ["Every couple months I\u2019ll take a step back and look at some of the natural patterns emerged with the photos that I shot.

But is there really a way to measure something that enhances a tree on the sidewalk like a simple bench? That single tree now has been transformed into something much more. It now offers shade to a public space that otherwise would have been unnoticed as people walk by. It opens up the sidewalk to something more than just a route from point A to B. \n While it\u2019s the first design like this that I\u2019ve come across I\u2019m sure there are many others of a similar nature out there. I don\u2019t have the back story on how the bench came to be but I think it would make a lot of sense for other\u2019s that have a storefront to consider such an idea.
