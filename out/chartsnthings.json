My colleague Xaqu\u00edn G.V. , who had done many of our soccer visualization in the World Cup in 2010, told me to talk to Opta , a company that specializes in this kind game data. \n A few emails, phone calls and data monkeying sessions later, my colleague Jeremy White and I had made charts for every player, highlighting short passes, that we really liked: \n \n Alas, there was not enough time to finish it, so on the shelf it went. \n But when the U.S. women made it to the Gold medal match, the code was right there to use again. Jeremy was busy visualizing the Twitter Olympics , but Xaqu\u00edn and Amanda Cox pitched in some soccer knowledge and gross XML parsing so we could make and interpret similar charts. After a lot of trial and error, we had mapped all the passes for all the U.S. players over the course of the entire tournament (made using R\u2019s basic plot and segments commands): \n \n We still needed some help understanding it, so we got in touch with Jay Cooney, an assistant coach at Stanford who had coached a some of the players on the national team.

The first time I ever saw the idea was in 2009, when my colleague Bill Marsh had a small piece in the Week in Review after Usain Bolt got a 9.58 in Berlin, setting the world record that still stands.\u00a0 \n \n Even this year, other news organizations did a similar approach. The Guardian made one in a retro homage to old video games and Slate had a piece based on the same concept. But one reason I think ours was so successful is that is put the race on a human scale \u2013 seeing all those athletes on an actual track is much more accessible than seeing a scatterplot. (Not that I didn\u2019t make tons of scatterplots since they don\u2019t really let me near the 3D software.) \n So Graham Roberts started rendering some people on a track based on some initial calculations. Even his first renderings looked pretty cool: \n \n \n After that, it was just a (very slow) process of storyboarding the video. It\u2019s surprising, to me, anyway, how much the final movie tracked our original storyboard: \n \n Then it was just a matter of rendering all the frames, recording and syncing the audio, and thinking about how to turn it around as soon as possible after the result. If you look closely, you can see that the 2012 results are out of frame for most of the movie \u2013 it was mostly pre-rendered. (We also recorded slightly different scripts depending on who won. I didn\u2019t really care who won, but I was sort of rooting against Churandy Martina of the Netherlands because I couldn\u2019t pronounce his name right. Luckily for me, he got sixth .)\u00a0 \n We didn\u2019t end up turning it around as fast as we wanted to, but about 8 hours after Bolt had won the 100-meter final, the piece was up, and only a day or two later Graham and I had achieved a life goal of having Ashton Kutcher tweet our work . \n \n We also did a chart for print, which went across two pages. Although we had done the chart in perspective for swimming (I\u2019ll get to that another time), the side view of these guys looked really cool, with Usain Bolt leading and everyone in history trailing behind.

In the week leading up it, my colleague Amanda Cox spent some time thinking how to best explain and contextualize this offering to readers. What follows is a series of sketches from Amanda, who shared her project folder with me for this post, and Matt Ericson, who edited the piece. \n The universe of initial public offerings is seemingly simple: about 2,400 tech companies since 1980, compiled by Jay Ritter , a professor of finance at the University of Florida. \n As a first step, Amanda charted the companies by I.P.O. date (x-axis) and value at I.P.O. (y-axis), colored them by their 3-year return. (The key\u2019s not included in her sketch, but for these purposes, know that red is bad and green is good.) \n \n This chart\u2019s not bad (even if, like me, you have low standards), but it doesn\u2019t say much other than that there was a dot-com boom, that most of those companies didn\u2019t do so well, and that Facebook is worth a ton of money. \n Next, a plot of 3-year return by I.P.O. date: \n \n Trying to add in more nuance to this picture, shading the companies by the companies\u2019 price-to-sales ratio at I.P.O. and including Facebook in a random position just for size: \n \n But rather than bringing clarity, it just sort of looked chaotic, even to the seasoned chart freaks of 620\u00a08th Avenue. So she tried another form: a histogram of 3-year returns, colored by I.P.O. date: \n \n Or the same chart but piled into three time periods (not that anyone asked me, but I really like this one): \n \n By the way, even the queen bee of statistical charting screws up that chart the first time (be conservative with your \u201ccex\u201d values, folks): \n \n Another idea, vaguely reminiscent of the balloons from \u201cUp,\u201d is sales vs. market cap at I.P.O. colored by year. I won\u2019t lie, I don\u2019t get this one: \n \n Going back to time series, which many readers are more accustomed to reading and understanding, Amanda focused on one thing that always gets talked about with IPOs: almost all of the companies have a bump in market cap after their first day of trading. So she charted the \u201ctrails\u201d of companies over their first day on the market (a log scale makes percentage changes look the same): \n \n The trails felt promising, so she pursued them with sales, too. (Along with some screw-ups.) Again, full transparency here, I don\u2019t get this one either, but since there are some screw-ups in there I think we\u2019re safe: \n \n At this point, there were a lot of charts made, but no clear answers about form or the best things to show. Matt Ericson, eyeing the looming deadlines, looked through Amanda\u2019s analysis and offered a compromise of sorts, related to the histogram she had generated earlier, and suggested a slightly different form: \n \n Which turned into this: \n \n And, ultimately, into this: \n \n If you\u2019ve seen the web version , though, you know it doesn\u2019t look like this. [Amanda thinks print graphics can be smarter than web graphics.] For one, the browser window doesn\u2019t give us this kind of space. But the medium itself plays a part too. Online, if you\u2019re not engaged in 10 seconds, you\u2019re not going to stay on the page, so they needed to keep it fun. For that, Amanda and Matt got some help from three (pretty badass) colleagues: Jeremy Ashkenas , Matt Bloch and Shan Carter . Together, they made an interactive chart that stepped through a handful of the steps above, slowly explaining the dataset, with each step building on the last: \n \n A couple major design processes are at work in this piece. First, sketching with data is massively important. Only by looking at the data in multiple forms, from different angles, did this group of visual journalists really peel back what was most interesting about it. Here, we saw histograms, crazy arrow charts, bubble charts, time series and others \u2013 all shaded with different variables. All but one, more or less, got cut. \n Second, and related, is that you go with the chart you have when the deadline comes \u2013 or that you\u2019re only as good as the last chart you threw away. (Her words, not mine.) \n To be quite honest, Amanda wasn\u2019t thrilled with her graphics that went in the paper and online. (She is always searching for The Perfect Form, whether or not it\u2019s there.) If the I.P.O. were delayed another week, there would be another dozen charts in the trash can and maybe something else would be the last good chart.

Also, labeling is hard on this thing, which is not a trivial problem. \n Lastly, (Dull) Giraffe: \n \n Seriously, this one is dull and maybe not worth discussing. Or is it? Discuss.\u00a0Any discussion of these forms might happen on Twitter under the hashtag #chartingSpiritAnimals until I figure out how to put comments into this site, which, let\u2019s face it, isn\u2019t ever going to happen.\u00a0 \n If you\u2019ve seen the graphic online or in print, you\u2019ll know that we went with the Blue Whale. Aside from carrying the crucial Steve Duenes/Matt Ericson/Amanda Cox voting bloc (their decisions somehow track the majority vote 100% of the time), it felt suited for the data and the story it was published with. \n \n (It looks fine\u00a0 online \u00a0too, but it\u2019s sort of stranded on its own URL.) \n Finally, as a disclaimer, the data plotted in these examples is slightly different than what went into print last week, as we did some manual tweaking on a handful of names, which moved a couple percentages up or down a tiny bit.\u00a0 \n Look forward to seeing if any data visualizers Tweet silly animal names this week.

The first one , made mostly by Shan Carter, was similar in many respects to the one he made in 2008 to show the differences in voters supporting Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. (Known internally as the \u201cdelightful dancing boxes.\u201d) \n This view, which focused on Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, was perfect for capturing the differences between their supporters, but we also wanted to show the influence of the other candidates, who have gotten substantial amounts of delegates. \n Shan addressed this with a quick sketch: \n \n Next they tried a ternary plot (I had to look it up myself), which is apparently beloved in geology and frequently to describe soil samples. Anyway, I came on to the project late, after the concept had been more or less decided. \n First, a sketch showing how voters of a single demographic group supported in 7 different states. (Groups that supported Mitt Romney are farther to the right; groups for Santorum are farther to the left; groups supporting anyone else are toward the bottom.) \n \n A different approach, and one we eventually went with, showed all the groups across a single state. This is for Iowa.\u00a0 \n \n\n Then we just tried to show this as best we could. One thought was to label the biggest groups and draw lines for the shift from another state. Here\u2019s who Michigan voters supported, with the lines emphasizing the main groups\u2019 change from New Hampshire. \n \n\n We really liked the lines in print, but once you animate the transitions you don\u2019t really need them, since the motion has the same effect. (Plus I didn\u2019t know how program the lines anyway.) \n Then we just had to build the thing, which we made using the D3 libraries .

This output showed charts for mentions of words, both cumulative and week-by-week, along with a list of the usage of each word in context: \n \n But presenting them was kind of a challenge. A straightforward approach (the only kind I know how to do, really) didn\u2019t do much for anyone and took up a ton of space, so we dumped it: \n \n We tried highlighting individual sentences (like \u201cYou\u2019ll have more luck getting a ticktack out of the mouth of an alligator than getting information, especially about injuries, out of the mouth of Bill Belichick,\u201d Aug. 10), but there wasn\u2019t anything cohesive about a random list of quotes. \n Then my boss said to write something original with the quotes as if I were writing for McSweeney\u2019s . I said, great idea, imagining something like \u201c Is It OK To Dunk On the President? \u201d, one of my favorite McSweeney\u2019s articles ever. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t get it to work. Luckily,\u00a0our intern, Ritchie King, who was already helping me with the analysis, was. \n He turned a handful of silly cliches into a hilarious narrative about sports, war and Tim Tebow. We made his cliches piece the center of the graphic and had Sam Sifton read it online. (If you haven\u2019t heard it yet, it\u2019s worth a listen .) \n  \n Anyway, it was a fun project and proof that data is out there for almost any crazy idea. It also emphasized two important lessons. One, from Amanda Cox, is that you should make a hundred charts and pick the best one. We definitely did that \u2013 our project folder is full of boring analysis of various players and ideas. The second lesson is that the design and editing machine of the NYT graphics department can take a decent idea and turn it into something much better. \n For the nerds out there, most of the analysis was done in R using the tm , openNLP and Rstem packages, but I can\u2019t be sure which methods I used from which since Amanda just told me to import all of them."], "link": "http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/post/17905392486", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nytimes.com/": 4, "http://www.mcsweeneys.net/": 2, "http://cran.r-project.org/": 3}, "blogtitle": "chartsnthings"}]
