But how to see this? \n Well, without loss of generality we can assume c = 1. So we want to know, if a and b are the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse 1, what is the largest possible value of a + b? \n Now a and b are, respectively, cos \u03b8 and sin \u03b8 for some acute angle \u03b8\u2026 so we want to maximize over acute angles $\\theta$. But how? Differentiate? That sounds like work. \n Take a look at the picture below. Imagine moving the upper right corner of the (black) right triangle along the (black) circular arc; we\u2019re looking for the point where the sum of the lengths of the legs is maximized. But now say we can move the upper right corner of the right triangle wherever we want it. As long as we stay along one of those red lines \u2014 which have slope -1, i. e. make a 45-degree angle with each axis, the sum of the leg lengths stays constant! \n  \n As we move the upper right corner along the circular arc, the sum of the leg lengths is maximized when it\u2019s locally constant \u2014 that is, when the circle is tangent to one of those lines. The red lines make a 45-degree angle with the coordinate axes; the optimal hypotenuse will be perpendicular to them, also making a 45-degree angle with the coordinate axes. The optimal right triangle is the one with 45-degree angles\u2026 so if its hypotenuse is 1, its legs are each , and their sum . (This is not the triangle in the plot \u2014 the triangle in the plot is in the 3-4-5 ratio. The sum of its legs is 1.4, not much short of optimality.) \n This is, secretly, the principle behind using Lagrange multipliers to maximize a function subject to a constraint.

Curious:What graph like? \n The th triangular number is about (more precisely, it\u2019s .) So there are about triangular numbers less than . Therefore, \u201con average\u201d, in each interval there are triangular numbers. \n For example, in the interval [9, 16) there are two triangular numbers, namely 10 and 15; this is f(3). In the interval [16, 25) there is one triangular number, namely 21; this is f(4). \n Let\u2019s write down an explicit formula for f(n). Let g(x) be the number of triangular numbers less than x. To figure this out, I\u2019ll introduce a function t(x), which takes as input x and outputs the index of x in the triangular-number sequence. For example, t(10) = 4, t(15) = 5. But we also want to be able to compute, say, t(12). But that\u2019s fine! t(n) is just the inverse of the function which takes n to the nth triangular number, the function ; in particular, solving the quadratic, \n \n So ; . \n Next we write g(x) in terms of t(x). It\u2019s tempting to say that g(x) = \\lfloor t(x) \\rfloor, but it\u2019s not. t(10) = 4, for example, but we want g(10) = 3. We\u2019ll say that \u2014 we\u2019ll only need this formula to work when x is an integer. So, for example, , and the index of 9.875 in the triangular number sequence, whatever that means, is between 3 and 4. But . \n Why the constant 1/8? Because \n \n which makes the formula marginally easier to write. \n Finally . Take the number of triangular numbers less than , and subtract the number less than , and you get the number in the interval in between. For example ; there are 6 triangular numbers less than 25, namely 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21. And . Thus , indicating the triangular number 21. So at long last we have the formula \n . \n In particular the arguments of these two floor functions differ by , which is between 1 or 2, so f(n) is always either 1 or 2. The graph that Tanton asked about is below. \n  \n You can see some hints of periodicity in the function; for example, from a quick glance at the graph it might look like has period 12, each period containing five 2s and seven 1s.
