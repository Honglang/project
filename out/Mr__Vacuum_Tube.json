The receiver can be used to receive the whole HF band (typically at 25 MHz bandwidth) simultaneously, and to receive multiple sounders simultaneously. The current receiver can be used to perform single or dual polarization (channel) soundings. The dual channel recorded can be used to determine the polarization form vertical soundings, or for angle of arrival measurements.
