Now Pacific Biosciences have taken another important step to further improve their product. \n Pacific Biosciences have now launched a new Sample Loading Device for the PacBio RS, called MagBead Station. \u00a0As\u00a0 Michael Hunkapiller, Ph.D. President and Chief Executive Officer of Pacific Biosciences told in their press release , they expect that with the new device, customers will\u00a0 \u201cbe able to generate 10 kilobase-sized libraries using as little as one microgram of sample, a five to 10-fold improvement from where we were just a few months ago\u201d. Also, because the new process is more robust, they expect that sequencing results will have higher overall consistency, allowing to run experiments also on challenging samples. \n First experiences of early-access-customers seem to underline these expections: \n As Patrick Hurban of Expression Analysis told InSequence , the new loading device allowed them to recover sequences also for \u201cdifficult\u201d samples: \u201cwe\u2019re much more confident on a sample-by-sample basis that we will be able to get good sequence\u201d, he said. Also, they could confirm that the amount of library that needs to be loaded is now significantly lower. The new loading process also seems to favor longer DNA fragments over shorter ones, excluding short contaminating DNA fragments. This results in a greater percentage of long reads in a run. Also, the loading process now seems to work as efficiently for the large insert libraries as it does for the smaller insert libraries. \n With the new loading device, about 50-60 % of the ZMWs are now active after loading. This is a great improvement compared to 30-45 % of active ZMWs before the upgrade. \n When PacBio started on the market, I was impressed by the sophisticated new technology. However, the results of the first projects were rather disappointing. The new loading device now seems to greatly improve the sample loading step. However, the high error rates still remain a challenge, with about 15% for the time being. Pac Bio will need to solve those issues if they want to be successful on the market in the long run.

A recent radio broadcast from NPR news summarises two scientist\u2019s opinions and their practical experiences with genome sequencing \u00a0(listen to the radio broadcast below). \n World renowned scientist James Watson, from the famous Watson & Crick team that discovered the DNA structure, recently sequenced his own genome. His discovery didn\u2019t earn him the next Nobel prize for science, but he found out that he belongs to the elite few people whose body is more sensitive to \u00df-blockers. Now James Watson finally realized why it was so difficult for him to balance his blood pressure. It definitely paid off for Watson to sequence his own genome since he could significantly reduce his weekly \u00df -blocker intake. But despite this \u201chealth-changing\u201d experience, he forbid his colleagues to reveal any information about his likelihood to develop Alzheimer. He said, \u201csince you cannot cure it why would you like to know about it?\u201d \n The second candidate to share his experience after he personally sequenced his genome is Stanford geneticist Michale Snyder . His genome sequencing revealed that he was at high risk to develop Type 2 diabetes. A few months after his discovery, Synder got the disease that his genome anticipated. Was this a coincidence or fate? For Snyder, knowledge about his genome gave him a head start against the disease.\u00a0 By completely transforming his diet and participating in various sport activities, \u00a0he overcame his Type 2 diabetes. \n From my perspective, both examples show that knowledge about our genetic information can be useful in preventing and treating diseases.
