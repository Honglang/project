I feel terribly guilty when I\u2019m sitting and staring at a blank page of my notebook for hours without respite. I try and force the ideas out, and won\u2019t step away from my desk until there\u2019s something on that page. But that just makes the block\u2019s hold on me stronger.\u00a0 \n Even though I know the worst thing to do is to sit there and wait until an idea magically pops into my head, I still do it, because if I try and occupy my mind with something else for an hour or so, the inevitable guilt sets in.\u00a0 \n But why do we do this to ourselves? Why make ourselves feel bad for something that we can\u2019t help? Is it because deep-down we feel that we can help it? That because we\u2019re in a creative job, we have a responsibility to be creative all the time? Or is it the pressure of looming deadlines and the possibility of failure?\u00a0Either way, no one should make themselves feel guilty because of it.\u00a0 \n There is a certain feeling of helplessness that accompanies creative block, and it can render an entire day wasted, but instead of sitting there moping about it, I should use that time to get away from the computer screen, to pick up a book or go for a walk\u2026 For most people (including me) inspiration doesn\u2019t just come out of thin air, and a blank Illustrator file has got to be about as uninspiring as it gets."], "link": "http://tiffanyfarrant.co.uk/post/34640287834", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Tiffany Farrant - Information Design"}, {"content": ["The History of Film \n This fantastically detailed graphic chronicles the history of feature films from the origins in the 1910s until the present day.

Finally, an official cartographic companion to the Song of Ice and Fire series! \n  \n I read a LOT of fantasy and sci-fi books and the first thing I always do when opening a new book is see if there\u2019s a map. I\u2019m always secretly disappointed when there isn\u2019t, but when there is there\u2019s something oddly satisfying about being able to plot out where each character is at any given time and to truly immerse yourself in the landscape. Maps also provide you with a sense of perspective and distance, something which can often be lost with words. \n  \n In no book I\u2019ve come across is a companion map more essential than with the Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) series, where there are hundreds, if not thousands, of characters and locations and a plethora of inter-weaving plots. The world George R. R. Martin has created is so vividly rich and detailed, that you can become utterly lost and disorientated without a map by your side, so it\u2019s super handy that there are a few small black and white maps included at the beginning of each book. \n However, having transitioned all of my reading activity to the Kindle half-way through the series, I got more and more frustrated that there wasn\u2019t an easy way for me to keep flicking back to the maps at the beginning of the book, not to mention that Kindle\u2019s zoom feature for images isn\u2019t the best, making the reading of said maps nigh impossible.\u00a0 \n So you can imagine how excited I was to see the announcement of the release of the official companion map book, which not only details all the locations in amazing detail (with colour!) but also tracks the paths of the main characters! \n I\u2019m probably more excited than I should be, but as someone who adores the Song of Ice and Fire universe and maps (not to mention, the book looks beautiful), this is something that I need to acquire.

But I think in today\u2019s time, where we\u2019re constantly online no matter where we are, it\u2019s so important to be able to take some time out to just log off and really get away from it all. It\u2019s nice to know that there are places out there that you can do just this, and anytime I\u2019m feeling fed up with the online world, or just want some distraction-free chillaxing time, I will definitely be heading back to this little cabin to wind-down and brew my coffee over an open fire!"], "link": "http://tiffanyfarrant.co.uk/post/33158210788", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Tiffany Farrant - Information Design"}, {"content": ["Putting things in perspective - The history of the Earth in 24 Hours\u00a0(via curiositycounts )"], "link": "http://tiffanyfarrant.co.uk/post/32865812390", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://curiositycounts.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Tiffany Farrant - Information Design"}, {"content": ["My office setup today whilst the decorators take the windows out of the other room\u2026 (Taken with Instagram )"], "link": "http://tiffanyfarrant.co.uk/post/32863377125", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://instagram.com": 1}, "blogtitle": "Tiffany Farrant - Information Design"}]
