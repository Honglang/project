So should Mitt Romney win on Nov. 6, it\u2019s difficult to see how people can continue to put faith in the predictions of someone who has never given that candidate anything higher than a 41 percent chance of winning (way back on June 2) and \u2014 one week from the election \u2014 gives him a one-in-four chance, even as the polls have him almost neck-and-neck with the incumbent. \n Why? \u00a0Why is it difficult to see that? \u00a0Does Dylan Byers not know the difference between saying something is unlikely to happen and declaring that it will not happen? \n Silver cautions against confusing prediction with prophecy. \u201cIf the Giants lead the Redskins 24-21 in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s a close game that either team could win. But it\u2019s also not a \u201ctoss-up\u201d: The Giants are favored. It\u2019s the same principle here: Obama is ahead in the polling averages in states like Ohio that would suffice for him to win the Electoral College. Hence, he\u2019s the favorite,\u201d Silver said. \n For all the confidence Silver puts in his predictions, he often gives the impression of hedging. Which, given all the variables involved in a presidential election, isn\u2019t surprising. For this reason and others \u2014 and this may shock the coffee-drinking NPR types of Seattle, San Francisco and Madison, Wis. \u2014 more than a few political pundits and reporters, including some of his own colleagues, believe Silver is highly overrated. \n Hey! \u00a0That\u2019s me! \u00a0I live in Madison, Wisconsin! \u00a0I drink coffee! \u00a0Wait, why was that relevant again? \n To sum up: \u00a0Byers thinks Nate Silver is overrated because he \u201chedges\u201d \u2014 which is to say,\u00a0 he gives an accurate assessment of what\u2019s going on instead of an inaccurate one. \n This makes me want to stab my hand with a fork. \n I\u2019m happy that Ezra Klein at the Post decided to devote a big chunk of words to explaining just how wrong this viewpoint is , so I don\u2019t have to. \u00a0You know what, though,\u00a0 I\u2019ll bet Ezra Klein drinks coffee."], "link": "http://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/if-you-cant-say-anything-intelligent-about-probability-dont-say-anything-at-all/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.politico.com/blog": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blog": 1}, "blogtitle": "Quomodocumque"}, {"content": ["I\u2019m working in the math department library today and have gotten distracted by a collection of historical math textbooks that\u2019s just gone on the shelves. \n From\u00a0 College Mathematics: \u00a0A First Course (1940), by W. W. Elliott and E. Roy C. Miles: \n The authors believe that college students who take only one year of mathematics should acquire a knowledge of the essentials of several of the traditional subjects. \u00a0From teaching experience, however, they are convinced that a better understanding is gained if these subjects are presented in the traditional order. \u00a0Students who take only one year of college mathematics are usually primarily interested in the natural sciences or in business administration. \n The book covers algebra, trigonometry, Cartesian geometry, and calculus. \u00a0The definition of the derivative as a limit is given, but the epsilon-delta definition of limit is not. \u00a0Startling to think that science majors came to college never having taken algebra or analytic geometry. \n Further back in time we get\u00a0 Milne\u2019s Progressive Arithmetic , from 1906. \u00a0This copy was used by Maggie Rappel, of Reedsville, WI, and is dated January 15th, 1908. \u00a0Someone \u2014 Maggie or a later owner \u2014 wrote in the flyleaf, \u201cLook on page 133.\u201d \n On the top of p .133 is written \n Auh! \u00a0Shut up your gab you big lobster, you c? \n You got me, Maggie! \n I can\u2019t tell what grades this book is intended for, but certainly a wide range; it starts with addition of single digits and ends with reduction of fractions to lowest terms. \u00a0What\u2019s interesting is that the book doesn\u2019t really fit our stereotype that math instruction in olden times was pure drill with no attention paid to conceptual instruction and explanation. \u00a0Here\u2019s a problem from early in the book: \n How many ones are 3 ones and 4 ones? \u00a0Write the sum of the ones under the ones. \u00a0How many tens are 6 tens and 2 tens? \u00a0Write the sum of the tens under the tens. \u00a0How do you read 8 tens and 7 ones? \u00a0What, then, is the sum of 24 and 63? \u00a0Tell what you did to find the sum. \n From the introduction: \n Yet the book is not merely a book of exercises. \u00a0Each new concept is carefully presented by questions designed to bring to the understanding of the pupil the ideas he should grasp, and then his knowledge is applied. \u00a0The formal statement of principles and definitions is, however, reserved for a later stage of the pupil\u2019s progress. \n Would these sentiments be so out of place in a contemporary \u201cdiscovery\u201d curriculum?"], "link": "http://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/historical-textbook-collection/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Quomodocumque"}, {"content": ["Debate trivialities: \u00a0some people were concerned that Obama pronouncing the name of the second-biggest nuclear power on the subcontinent as \u201cPah-ki-stahn,\u201d rather than \u201cPack-i-stan,\u201d sent the wrong message. \u00a0Apparently this issue is not a new one \u00a0for the President. \n My first reaction is to say \u201cWhy not pronounce it Pah-ki-stahn if that\u2019s how the Pah-ki-stanis pronounce it?\u201d \u00a0And in some sense the world is moving in that direction. \u00a0It used to be customary to say \u201cEye-rack\u201d and \u201cEye-ran\u201d \u2014 my sense is that standard newcaster usage has shifted from Eye-rainians to Ee-rahnians. \u00a0(What does Romney say?
