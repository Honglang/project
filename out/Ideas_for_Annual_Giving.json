good place to learn about fundamental business principles like the importance of customer service or the way that incentives (e.g., tips) can impact employee performance.\u00a0 On a personal note, I can also say (15 years later) that working in a restaurant is also a good place to meet a future spouse. \n Like most industries, the restaurant world has its own unique character and culture.\u00a0 It even has its own language.\u00a0 For example, \u201ceighty six\u201d means to remove a dish from the menu because the kitchen no longer has it in stock.\u00a0 \u201cIn the weeds\u201d refers to a waiter or waitress who is overwhelmed and can\u2019t keep up with their orders. \n Annual Giving has its own unique culture too with its own set of characteristics and its own language.\u00a0 \u201cLybunts\u201d, for example, are donors who made a gift last year but who have not yet made a gift this year and \u201cretention rate\u201d is the percentage of prior year donors who also made a gift in the following year. \n Learning the language is a good first step for newcomers to any business or culture.\u00a0 Leaders , though, need to understand the new ideas, trends, and techniques as they evolve.\u00a0 We call these \u201cbest practices.\u201d \n Don\u2019t confuse best practices with solutions or answers.\u00a0 Every organization is unique in some way.\u00a0 However, best practices provide leaders with context for their industry.\u00a0 They represent conventional wisdom.\u00a0 They suggest what has (or hasn\u2019t worked) for others so that they can think about what to include in their own strategy.\u00a0 There are many ways to learn about best practices: \n \n Hire a consultant who has worked with other similar organizations to tell you what they are seeing and hearing \n Pick up the phone and ask a colleague what their programs are doing \n Attend a conference \n Read an article or an expert\u2019s blog \n Conduct a survey \n \n Understanding best practices comes with many benefits.\u00a0 The most important benefit of all, though, is that understanding best practices helps keep leaders out of the weeds."], "link":

driven and being selfish.\u201d\u00a0 He makes a great point. \n For those of us who work in philanthropy, there are a few fine lines that we need to be mindful of ourselves.\u00a0 For example, there\u2019s a difference between: \n \n An annual fund and annual giving \n Being friendly and being phony \n Personalization and computerization \n A receipt and a thank you \n Research and prying \n Hearing and listening \n A volunteer and a volunteer leader \n Fundraising and development \n \n We should also remind ourselves of one other great piece of advice that Kenny has echoed through the

an excuse to do something the right way. \n We launch campaigns because they work, because people respond to goals and deadlines, and because (deep down) everyone wants to belong to something larger

because a lot of people got involved.\u00a0 It\u2019s usually because great leaders got involved. \n I know someone who likes to say:\u00a0 when campaigns fail, it\u2019s usually not for a lack of

entrepreneur.\u00a0 He\u2019s got a great blog and a great book on analytics for fundraising.\u00a0 Check him out here ! \n Last May, I got to hear Josh address a group of fundraisers at a conference in Portland, OR.\u00a0 He was talking about some research that his company had done around what donors expect from the organizations they support.\u00a0 As usual, he cited some good data points and made a funny joke or two, but then he said one of the most interesting things I\u2019d ever heard:\u00a0 Stewardship , he said, may not be your #1 priority, but you can bet it\u2019s the #1 priority for your donors. \n That\u2019s brilliant, I thought.\u00a0 I\u2019ll have to use that line someday. \n Six months later I got my chance when\u00a0I found myself addressing a\u00a0class of college students in a course on philanthropy.\u00a0 About ten minutes into my talk, I decided to go for\u00a0it:\u00a0 Stewardship , I said, may not be your #1 priority, but you can bet it\u2019s the #1 priority for your donors. \n That went well, I thought to myself, and continued talking until one of the students interrupted with a question.\u00a0 I keep hearing that term stewardship , she said, but what does it actually mean?\u00a0 There was an awkward silence until I managed to\u00a0answer\u00a0(without much confidence) that stewardship was the way we thank our donors . \n On the way home from class I thought to myself, that was the wrong answer. \n What I should have said is that part of stewardship is the way we thank our donors.\u00a0 Indeed, the promptness of a gift receipt or the personalization of a handwritten thank you note are important ingredients of stewardship.\u00a0 But it\u2019s also\u00a0a newsletter story about gift impact or\u00a0a picture of those impacted smiling in a magazine.\u00a0 It\u2019s\u00a0a name on a recognition list, an invitation to a party, coffee with a gift officer, or even a simple birthday card.\u00a0 It\u2019s also the next solicitation and
