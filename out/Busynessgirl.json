I suspect this feeling of uncertainty will pass with time, but for now, it\u2019s a strange way to wake up in the morning. \n I always worried that I would miss teaching if I left, but so far that hasn\u2019t happened. \u00a0Perhaps it\u2019s because my job keeps me pretty busy. Like teaching, there is an endless list of things I could be accomplishing, so I\u2019m never bored. \n I\u2019ve been trying to understand work-life balance as it pertains to my new position. \u00a0As an educator, there was no work-life balance during the semester. \u00a0If you weren\u2019t teaching, you were either planning to teach, grading papers, or doing a post-mortem on something you taught and trying to figure out how to make it better the next time around. \u00a0I worked from the moment I woke up till the time I dropped into bed exhausted, 7 days a week, week after week. \n There seems to be a little space for the possibility of a life outside of work now that I\u2019m not teaching. \u00a0Email slows to a trickle (if any) on the weekend. \u00a0There\u2019s a definite lull in work activity after 6pm every day as people go home to their families and spend time with them. \u00a0This has been the strangest thing to get used to. Students communicated\u00a0indiscriminately\u00a0throughout the week \u2013 no time was sacred and responses were always expected and expected quickly. \u00a0How strange it is to turn off email on a Saturday and not worry about an angry student escalating their problem to an administrator while you enjoy a day off. \n\n Possibly Related Posts: \n \n New Chapter: Life Reboot \n Self Evaluation: List of Fives \n Powerless (aka Life Without Internet, Round 3) \n Year in Review 2010 \n What is a Doctorate?

Click on it and subscribe to the RSS for new content. \n Lazarus Form Recovery : You know how the browser inevitably crashes when you\u2019re writing a paragraph of text in a conference proposal? \u00a0Lazarus autosaves all the text you enter in form fields. \u00a0When the browser crashes, you\u2019ll recover that text. \n Thesaurus Extension : Highlight a word with your cursor, right-click (Mac: CMD-click or 2-finger tap) on the word, choose the thesaurus option. \n  To delete an extension, turn one off, or change the settings, go to the Chrome \u201cwrench\u201d in the upper right-hand corner, then \u201cTools\u201d, then \u201cExtensions.\u201d Click on image to enlarge. \n Video Extensions \n Turn Off the Lights : When there is video content on a page, you\u2019ll see the ToTL icon turn black. Click it and the rest of the screen will fade out so that you can watch the video without distraction. \n QuietTube : Send viewers to a Youtube video without all the ads and other video suggestions. This is fantastic for instructors that want to strip off all the video suggestions and the advertisements (well, most of them). \n Bookmarking and Sharing \n Mindomo Bookmarks : When you visit a webpage that you\u2019d like to add to your mindmaps, click Mindomo Bookmarks to import the URL and site description to your Mindomo Account (you need to set up or link to an existing Mindomo account to do this \u2013 make sure you manually set up an account, don\u2019t use the auto-setup from Gmail or Facebook). \u00a0When you go to Mindomo, you can quickly move those links to the appropriate mindmap branches. \n bitly Bookmarks : I have to say that I used to like this extension a lot. \u00a0It used to be that in one click, you could send a URL and site description to your Twitter account. \u00a0Now it takes 4 clicks to do the same thing, and you can\u2019t add hashtags to the end of a tweet anymore. \u00a0Hashtags will appear before the URL. \u00a0So any functionality that depends on the hashtag on the end of a Tweet will no longer work. \u00a0I\u2019m replacing this one with Hootsuite, but it still might be useful for you if you\u2019re also looking for a Bookmark manager. \n Hootsuite Hootlet : \u00a0Quickly share with any/all of your social media sites. Schedule messages for later. \n Readability : \u00a0View any article in an easy-to-read font of your choice, in the width of your choice, without all the ads and other crap on webpages. \n Send from Gmail : Click the icon to send the website URL and description to someone using your Gmail account. \n Miscellaneous \n AdBlock : Block most advertisements on webpages. \u00a0Note: You will sometimes have to turn this off to get a website to load properly. \n StayFocusd : Increase your productivity by enforcing self-imposed rules about how much time you can spend on a given website (like, ahem, Facebook). \n Designing or Editing a website? \n WhatFont : Just hover over the text on a webpage and a tool tip pops up to tell you what the font is. \n Color Picker : An eyedropper tool that tells you what the color you\u2019re looking at on a webpage is. \n To make this list more dynamic (and easy to find in the future), I\u2019ll house a permanent collection of great Chrome extensions under the Resources Tab: Chrome Extensions from now on. \n\n Possibly Related Posts: \n \n The Evolution of the Illustrated Prezis \n Self Evaluation: List of Fives \n Triple Click \n Turning Ideas into Action \n TEDxMuskegon: A Recipe for Free Range Learning"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TeachingCollegeMath/~3/mqdUiQlASiY/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"https://chrome.google.com/": 13, "http://quietube.com/": 1, "http://www.addtoany.com/": 1, "http://busynessgirl.com/": 9}, "blogtitle": "Busynessgirl"}, {"content": ["I have this sneaky trick I use to tell which students watch online videos and which don\u2019t. \u00a0I hide \u201csecret codes\u201d in the videos (like the programmer\u2019s Easter Eggs). \u00a0When a student finds one of my \u201cEaster Egg codes\u201d they can submit it for 1 point towards participation. \u00a0Sometimes the codes are numbers I generate at random (Ex: 40234) and sometimes it\u2019s a word, phrase, or story (my cat is chasing a fly in front of my computer). \n I don\u2019t tell the students where the codes are. I don\u2019t tell them HOW I\u2019ve shared the code or what kind of code it is. \u00a0Some videos have codes, and many don\u2019t. \u00a0Because of the random distribution of codes in videos, and my \u201cloose\u201d way of collecting them for points, I can always add or remove videos with codes, and it won\u2019t affect the overall point system. \n  Here's an example of a video code inserted as a callout bubble. Click on image to enlarge. \n Let me explain. Students are not required to watch particular videos and there are two other ways to earn participation points. \u00a0Participation for each unit is counted out of 10 points, but 5 extra credit points may also be earned. \u00a0Thus, there is a cap on the total number of points I will count. \n Participation points can be earned by: \n \n Participating in a live online chat. (2 points) \n Posting something substantive in a Discussion. (1 point) \n Turning in a video code. (1 point) \n \n Here are various ways that I hide the codes in videos: \n \n In callout bubbles I add post-recording and pre-production \n On calculator screens (sneaky, huh?) \n In something I say out loud \n In something I write on the journaling screen \n In something I say and write on the journaling screen \n In the text of a math equation \n Underlining a particular word or phrase on the screen from a lesson \n An action to take (call my office phone and sing the quotient rule to me) \n \n Collecting the codes is the real trick. \u00a0Some years I\u2019ve used a Google Spreadsheet or Doc for the collection. \u00a0This year, I\u2019m using the comment field of the Canvas Graded Discussions. \u00a0I set up one Discussion for each unit, worth 10 points. \u00a0When a student participates in an online chat, I go to the gradebook for this Discussion and add a comment \u201cChat 7/9/12 = 2 points\u201d for that student. \u00a0When the student submits a video code, I go to the gradebook for this Discussion and add the comment \u201cVideo Code\u00a040234 = 1 point\u201d. \u00a0Then when I go to grade the assignment, I see not only all the students\u2019 discussion posts, but also all their collected codes and chat points (see image). \n  Canvas Discussions grading screen with comments. Click on image to enlarge. \n It\u2019s really interesting to see which students find and submit the codes and which students never submit a single code. This helps me to track the progression of students through a particular unit. \u00a0Pessimistically, it helps me to \u201ccatch\u201d those students who claim they are watching videos when, in fact they aren\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0But optimistically, I can also tell who consistently watches all the videos by seeing their collected codes pile up. \u00a0While I haven\u2019t always enjoyed keeping lists of students and codes, the \u201cEaster Egg\u201d method has worked well over the years to keep track of video-watching as a way to participate in online courses. \n\n Possibly Related Posts: \n \n New Chapter: Life Reboot \n Online Office Hours in Instructure Canvas \n Mobile Phone Cameras in Teaching and Learning \n Tears of Joy: Canvas Analytics is ON \n Google Hangout + TED Talks = CONNECT"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TeachingCollegeMath/~3/oDjfwGffT0g/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.addtoany.com/": 1, "http://busynessgirl.com/": 7}, "blogtitle": "Busynessgirl"}, {"content": ["For the last year, I\u2019ve felt this yearning to do something different. I\u2019ve been a full-time faculty member for a decade now, teaching many of the same courses semester after semester after semester after \u2026 yeah, well, you get it. \n A series of conferences and events in the last 6 months has made me realize that my \u201calignment\u201d between my passions and my job was off. \u00a0I attended the UpToAllOfUs un-conference in February, and felt a strong pull to do something different, something more amazing. \u00a0I attended the TEDxSummit in April, and coming back to work was like a rude awakening after being in a liquid network of ideas for 5 days. And then I attended the LAK conference and really just felt unsettled about how I was spending my time. \n Since I began blogging in 2007, I\u2019ve learned about so many things in my free time: education technology, the scholarship of teaching and learning, social media, data visualizations, professional development for faculty, higher education, leadership, learning analytics, eLearning strategies, game design, writing, speaking, technology for productivity, mobile apps, and \u2026 well, probably a lot of things that aren\u2019t coming to mind right now. \u00a0In this decade I\u2019ve finished a Ph.D., made a name for myself as a futurist, and connected with instructors, innovators, and futurists around the world. \n Now, the time has come to shed one identity (math faculty) and take on a new one. \u00a0It\u2019s actually an identity I\u2019ve been donning in my \u201cfree\u201d time for a while now, I\u2019m just shifting the focus to it full-time now. \n I have accepted a position as the Director of Learning and Research\u00a0 at Instructure (they build the Canvas learning platform), in Sandy, Utah. \u00a0\u00a0The position will give me a chance to grow professionally, to use all the skills I\u2019ve learned in the last five years, to work with some really amazing, talented, and energetic people, \u00a0and (bonus) I get to move back to the mountains. \n  The view from the Instructure building. \n Why Instructure? After all my complaining (for years) about the state of the LMS market, I began using Canvas in May and fell head-over-heels in love with it.

I say \u201cwe\u201d because the presentations are mine, but I couldn\u2019t do them without the help of an incredibly talented illustrator, Mat Moore. \n We\u2019ve worked together on illustrating books and presentations for three years now, and I\u2019m pretty sure that Mat can now read my mind. Our process now goes something like this. \n I call Mat and say \u201cI need a new illustration, as detailed as possible (translation: I\u2019m paying top dollar \u2013 make it awesome!), on the Future of Working. Because a lot of what I\u2019m talking about will be related to digital and virtual work, it would be cool if the illustration was a corporate office park, but built entirely out of computer chips \u2013 remember we started doing an illustration like that once? Well, let\u2019s really go all out this time.\u201d Mat: \u201cOkay.\u201d \n  First (Rough) Draft of \"Future of Working\"    Click on Image to Enlarge. \n At some point a few days later, I get a draft. It is a ROUGH of what the sketch might look like. Just like with software design, it\u2019s really better to make changes here, before the really hard work of illustration is done. This is the point where you have to tell the illustrator if you hate it, want specific details, etc. Sometimes I know that I want some very specific elements in the presentation (for example, in past presentations, I\u2019ve asked for a money tree, a person straddling the \u201cInternet\u201d pipes holding a laptop, etc.). This is the time to tell your illustrator about anything specific that you really NEED to be in that illustration. It will be much harder to add it later. \n At this point in our working relationship, Mat knows that he needs to leave me blank spaces, roughly rectangular in shape, to add the presentation elements. We didn\u2019t know this when we first started doing these presentations, it has been a feature that has evolved over time. If you look carefully, you\u2019ll see that every illustration has space specifically left for this purpose now. When I get next version of the illustration from Mat, there is still a little back and forth between us as we tweak the illustration. \n Once I\u2019m on the final version, I have to produce a SWF file for the illustration (the PDF versions are usually too big to be processed by Prezi). Then I look for the blank canvases that Mat has left me in the illustration. Here are a few examples of places where I will drop the \u201cslides\u201d in this presentation. \n  Nice rectangular spaces on this computer chip. Perfect for a sequence of slides on the same topic. Click on image to enlarge. \n  Here's an example of some less structured space that was left blank for me to add presentation elements. You can see the \"before\" and \"after\" in the comparison. Click on the image to enlarge. \n  Here you can see the same illustrated space without and then with the presentation elements. Click on image to enlarge. \n In the final version, the presentation elements are so integrated with the image, that it can actually be difficult to spot them. The only real indicators are because the presentation elements introduce an element of color to the black & white canvas. \n  Final \"Future of Working\" Prezi.

Please view with a computer for now. \n\n Possibly Related Posts: \n \n Resources for Data Literacy \n Future of Working \n Tears of Joy: Canvas Analytics is ON \n Google Hangout + TED Talks = CONNECT \n Web Tools to Enhance Learning"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TeachingCollegeMath/~3/GkXIV64gCRE/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.addtoany.com/": 1, "http://busynessgirl.com/": 5, "http://vcampus.mccvlc.org/": 1, "http://www.mindomo.com/": 4}, "blogtitle": "Busynessgirl"}]
