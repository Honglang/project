If a specific trait is conferred by a dominant allele and both parents are heterozygous, then their child can lack a trait that they share.   2) Features are not genes . Some traits (features) are affected by many genes, and many genes affect multiple traits.   3) Many traits are complex . Geneticists distinguish between simple (Mendelian) traits and complex traits. Traits can show the following sorts of genetic complexity:  epistasis (where the effect of one gene depends on other genes)  incomplete penetrance (where a specific genotype doesn't always have the usual effect)  polygenic inheritance (where multiple genes affect the trait)  genetic heterogeneity (where different genes cause the same trait in different families or populations)  phenocopy (when traits that often have a genetic basis arise without a genetic basis)   Explaining all of this in detail would require a complete course in genetics!"], "link": "http://ongenes.blogspot.com/feeds/23879927165065976/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Information on Genes"}, {"content": ["I did a post to my blog ( here ) about hybrid sunfish and wanted to ask the genetic experts for some clarification.

Is there any software for plotting possible/probable relationships to MRCA [most recent common ancestor] for groups of 10-1,000 cousin matches suggested by various services, e.g. 23andMe, GEDmatch, FTDNA?      It seems to me that standard genealogical services are too rigid. Once you lay down a line of possible 3 rd cousins and another for 4 th cousins etc, linking them to various MRCAs who are perhaps 5 or 6 away becomes a bit of a nightmare.    The cousin matches referred to are typically based on shared segments longer than some threshold (typically 5 cM.) that appear to be identical by descent (IBD). In my case, 23andMe identifies 835 relatives but I know how I am related to only two (my mother and my sister).  I will contact scientists I know who work in this field to see if there is any software that is available to, and usable by, the general (informed, curious and sophisticated) public.  If you know of software that might be useful and want to see some of this data, I can send examples from 23andMe. It lists all IBD regions longer than the threshold that are shared with the user.

In fact, they will represent any relationship pictorially. If you have an account there, you can compare your genome to another, with regions of half-identity and full-identity marked differently.   This pair of images shows regions of half-identity (light blue), complete identity (black)and no identity (white). The comparison on the left shows two women who share a father but have different mothers. Since they both have their father's complete X chromosome, they are half-identical across this entire chromosome. The rest of the genome is an even mix of regions that are half identical and regions that show no identity. On the right, you see a 1:2:1 ratio of no identity, half-identity and full identity. The most telling difference between these comparisons is the complete lack of regions with full identity when half-siblings are compared. If you subscribe to 23andMe, you can make similar images between any pair of shared genomes using their family inheritance genome view tool, at https://www.23andme.com/you/inheritance/ .  Andrea Badger, who sent me these specific images, also collected data on the fraction of the genome identical by descent when different types of relative are compared. She found that full siblings shared between 41% and 55% of their genomes (16 comparisons) while half siblings shared between 21.7 and 31.4% of their genomes (four comparisons). The expected fractions are 50% and 25%, but there is some spread.  This is why having lots of markers is important. When the whole genome is analyzed, the difference is clear. With a smaller number of markers, statistical fluctuations are more likely to confuse the issue. 23andMe now uses over 1 million markers. Family Tree DNA uses fewer markers and charges more, but they use plenty of markers (hundreds of thousands) and have a greater focus on genealogy.

They all concern the issue of half-siblings, and the utility of genetic tests for establishing such a relationship. 1) Is it absolutely possible to tell if two females have the same father? These supposedly half sisters do not share the same mother. The father in question is deceased. Will our DNA reveal, certainly, that we share the same father? How do we find a reliable U.S. company to do this for us? Information from a company like 23andme will provide you with enough markers to be completely sure. I'm not entirely sure how their interface works, so I can't tell you how easy the interpretation will be, but there will be enough data for you to be sure, and you will be able to get help with the interpretation. The reason is that two women who share a father will have an entire X chromosome in common. That is extremely unlikely to occur otherwise. 2) My sister donated a kidney to me. We were told that we matched 5 out of 6 genetic markers. From that information, is it possible to make an \"educated guess\" as to whether we are more likely to be full or half sisters? We believed we were half-sisters but some interesting coincidences lead me to believe that we may be full-sisters. The six markers used for this test are not conclusive. As you know, even half-siblings can be a perfect match. A conclusive test would require many markers. Fortunately, companies like 23andme and Navigenetics provide information about many markers (about 450,000), and those tests could tell you definitively. If you are full siblings, then there will be parts of the genome (about one-fourth of the total) where you are identical for long stretches. That would be extremely unlikely if you are only half siblings. However, a small number of markers (less than 200 or so) would make it harder to make a definitive distinction between being half siblings and being full siblings. Six is definitely too few. 3) I wonder if you could help me. In trying to find my biological father, I came up with what could be two half siblings. The parents in both cases are deceased. I have been given a price of $500 for the three of us to test by saliva. Do you think without any parents, this could prove half siblings or would it be a waste of money? You will share one of your two alleles with a half-sibling at about half of the sites in your genome. So, the answer is that with enough markers (thousands) the answer will be absolutely clear. The source of DNA (saliva, cheek swab, blood) does not matter much. 23andme will do about 450,000 markers for $400 (per person) and give you lots of additional information. The technology is pretty standard so other firms are probably OK. Just make sure that there are many markers (more than 100,000) and that you get access to the data (not just their interpretation of the data). Once you get your results you'll want to look for large regions of the genome where you and the putative half-sibling share markers. Of course, your putative half-siblings will have to agree to this analysis. 4) I heard that a recent study proved that men don't have half children but any children by the same man are full brothers and sisters irregardless of all different birth mothers. Is there a genetic truth to this?   Two children with the same father and different mothers are referred to as half - siblings . What you are referring to is almost certainly a legal or cultural distinction, not the sort of thing that can be proved by a study. -------------------------------------- As usual, I invite additional answers in the form of comments.

This is a question about the availability of genetic tests that distinguish full siblings (such as sisters with the same mother and father) from half siblings (such as sisters with the same mother but different fathers). Although full siblings, like parent-child pairs, share half of their alleles, the analysis is a bit trickier. Consider these examples: The numbers here represents the allelic state of one marker. Each child inherits one allele (one version of the marker) from each parent. In this example, Amy has inherited allele 1 from her father and allele 3 from her mother. Because children must share one allele with each of their parents it is relatively easy to rule out paternity. For example, P2 cannot be Brooke's father because he has completely different alleles from her (1 and 5 vs. 2 and 3). Unlike parents and their children, full siblings can have completely different alleles ( e.g. Amy and Casey). Since the question refers to three sisters, it would be possible to rule out all three having the same father ( e.g. sisters with genotype 1/3 (Amy), 2/3 (Brooke) and 5/3 (Dawn) cannot all be full sisters because there are three different alleles in combination with the 3, and a single parent can only contribute two possible alleles). However, this is not always the case, and it is even possible for half-sisters to have the same genotype at any one marker (e.g. Amy and Erin) because any two possible fathers could share one or two alleles by chance. Thus, distinguishing full-siblings from half-siblings comes down to statistics, and \"results\" are reported as probabilities. Since that is the case, the more markers the better. Many of the genetic testing services probably aren't using enough markers (but they do provide guidance as to how (un)reliable their result is). On the other hand, a full genotyping service, like 23andme , which uses thousands of markers, would provide a reliable result. So, the bottom line is yes, you can determine, with confidence, whether three sisters have the same father by testing the sisters . However, you need to use a lot of markers to do it, and most genetics testing companies probably don't use enough.

Our newly born son has detached earlobes. How is this possible since attached earlobes are recessive? - Curious  That is a great question. Many of us learned in high school that attached earlobes are recessive, and it is easy to find that information repeated on the web as an illustration of dominance patterns. An example is the detailed treatment at the Singapore Science Center , which explores various possible parental combinations and concludes that \"if both parents were homozygous recessive, they could not have a child with the dominant allele.\" That is certainly true, and it seems to make a liar out of Curious. Was her child switched in hospital? Should Curious become Alarmed or Suspicious? I don't think so. I could not find the source of the \"fact\" that attached earlobes are recessive.  I consulted OMIM (the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), and they have very little ( OMIM 128900 ). What they do have calls into question the assumption that \"attached earlobes are recessive.\" Free earlobes are dominant in the view of some. Dutta and Ganguly (1965) suggested polygenic inheritance. There is a variety that is perhaps better classified as 'lobeless' than 'attached.' Lai and Walsh (1966) concluded that 'a simple Mendelian gene effect is unlikely to be responsible for the earlobe types.' The other issue raised here is whether or not free earlobes is even a bivariate trait (in which case everyone's earlobes could be categorized as either attached or detached). That is necessary for simple dominance to make sense. In the words of students from Willowbrook high school who did a study of this, \"it's harder to tell earlobes, so the count on these could be less accurate.\" OMIM states that \"there is a variety that is perhaps better classified as 'lobeless' than 'attached.'\" Different forms might show different patterns of inheritance. I suspect that this, along with a large number of ordinary traits, will be examined anew in the era of personal genomics. For example, the people at deCODE genetics just published a report on the genetics of hair and skin pigmentation (Sulem et al., 2007: Nature Genetics 39:1443 , PMID 17952075 ). Perhaps earlobes will be next.  This question may be most important as a cautionary tale about genetics education.

I side with those who feel that race, as it is normally understood, is a social construct. Those biological definitions that might be partially valid for humans differ significantly from the way the concept is normally used in our society. However, others argue for the importance of considering \"ethnicity\" in clinical trial design ( Taylor et al. 2005 ), and the drug BiDil has been licensed exclusively for African-Americans (for a recent news report in \"The Times\" click here ). So, my answer to this questions has been given before . It seems to me that if a drug differs in either safety or efficacy for one \"race\" or another, then the underlying basis is probably either a genetic difference or a cultural difference.
