We\u2019re a startup, so this means prioritizing the set of questions we look into in the context of what will be most beneficial for the rest of the business, for the short and long-term, by creating opportunity and opening up potential futures. We work on a wide variety of projects, from pure research to press collaborations to infrastructure and experimental\u00a0products . \n We always have a list of research questions way longer than we have time and resources to pursue, so we developed a process for evaluating whether a given question is worth pursuing at a particular time. \n This is the kind of process that I\u2019ve only discussed with several people over whisky (thanks!), but not seen written up. I initially had a much longer list of questions but have decided to keep it as simple as possible, to frame a discussion but not dictate or burden it. I hope it\u2019s helpful and I would love to hear about other appproaches. \n For each research question that we might look into, we ask the following: \n \n State the research question. \n How do we know when we\u2019ve won? \n Assume we\u2019ve solved this question perfectly. What are the first things that we\u2019ll build with it? \n If everyone in the world uses this, how does it change human behavior? \n What\u2019s the most evil thing that can be done with this? \n \n State the research question. \n It\u2019s important to state the question in language that everyone can understand. The bitly team comes from a variety of scientific and business backgrounds, and we\u2019ve developed some of our own common vocabulary, but it still takes a bit of effort to make sure that everyone understand the fundamental challenge and why it\u2019s interesting. \n How do we know when we\u2019ve won? \n Here we define the metrics that we\u2019ll use to measure our success. For some questions, this is obvious, and for others it\u2019s impossible to define \u2014 we can at least acknowledge that ahead of time. \n Assume we\u2019ve solved this question perfectly. What are the first things that we\u2019ll build with it? \n This question allow us to assess the potential business and product impact. What capabilities will we have with this that we don\u2019t have now? It allows us to keep the long-term research vision in mind while still optimizing for shorter-term opportunities. \n If everyone in the world uses this, how does it change human behavior? \n What\u2019s the maximum potential impact of this work? If it\u2019s not inspiring, is it worth pursuing at all? \n What\u2019s the most evil thing that can be done with this? \n I don\u2019t ask this question to encourage evil (>:]) but as a creative tool for expanding how we think about validity, impact, and potential applications of the research. The label evil is so ridiculous that it permits people share their craziest ideas. Plus, it\u2019s always a fun conversation to have. \n Finally \n I\u2019m always revising this list, and I would love to hear how you think about\u00a0prioritizing\u00a0your work."], "link": "http://www.hilarymason.com/blog/how-do-you-prioritize-research/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://dev.bitly.com/": 1, "http://bitlyscience.github.com/": 1, "http://rt.ly/": 1}, "blogtitle": "hilarymason.com"}, {"content": ["I\u2019m extremely excited about DataGotham , a conference that I\u2019m co-hosting with friends and fellow New York data nerds Drew , John , and Mike . \n DataGotham is a celebration of the NYC data community, and will bring together professionals from all industries in New York that are built around data, from finance to fashion and from startups to the Fortune 500 and government.
