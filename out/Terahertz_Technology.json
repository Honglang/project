DOI: 10.1117/2.1201210.004477 \n \n \n \n \nThe word \u2018laser\u2019 originally stood for \u2018light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.\u2019 In polariton lasers, the radiation is emitted spontaneously, but it possesses all the characteristic properties of laser light: it is coherent in the first and second order and monochromatic. The concept of polariton lasers was formulated by Imamo\u011flu and coauthors in 1996. 1 They are based on a type of quasiparticle called the exciton-polariton, which is made of light and matter and occurs in suitably designed semiconductor crystal structures. \n \nExciton-polaritons arise from interactions between excitons (neutral quasiparticles formed from bound electron-hole pairs) and photons (for instance, modes of visible light trapped in a semiconductor structure). Being bosons, exciton-polaritons can form condensates, similar to the Bose-Einstein condensates observed in gases of cold atoms. These condensates, in which large quantities of exciton-polaritons accumulate in a single quantum state, form the basis of the polariton laser. The exciton-polariton lifetime is much shorter than a nanosecond, and they decay by passing their energy to photons, which escape from the crystal. Being generated by identical exciton-polaritons, these emitted photons form monochromatic, coherent light. \n \nPolariton lasers have been realized in semiconductor microcavities: multilayer crystal structures in which light confined between two parallel mirrors strongly interacts with the elementary excitons in the crystal. In 1998, Le Si Dang and coauthors observed polariton lasing at liquid-helium temperature. 2 The first room-temperature polariton laser with optical pumping was realized in 2007 by a collaboration of the Southampton and Lausanne groups. 3 At present, optimized schemes of electrically pumped polariton lasers based on gallium nitride (GaN) microcavities are discussed in the literature 4 (see Figure 1 ). \n \n  \n \n Figure 1. Schematic of an electrically pumped polariton laser based on a gallium nitride (GaN) microcavity with embedded indium gallium nitride (InGaN)/GaN quantum wells (QWs).

FS: Freestanding. \n \n \nPolariton lasers are expected to have lower thresholds than conventional semiconductor lasers. 4 Their output power is quite limited, however, because exciton-polaritons dissociate at strong pumping. Consequently, the area of application for polariton lasers still needs to be defined. Two promising directions stand out: high-speed optical polarization switches and compact sources of terahertz radiation. \n \nOptical polarization switches, or spin switches, enable light of a chosen circular polarization to be switched on and off in an optoelectronic device. Conventional approaches to such switching are typically based on nonlinear optical effects, which require high power and external optical elements. Spin switches based on polariton lasers instead exploit the spin properties of exciton-polaritons and the strong interactions induced between exciton-polaritons by their matter (exciton) component. Like photons, exciton-polaritons have two values of spin polarization, corresponding to left and right circularly polarized light, respectively. The polarization of light emitted by a polariton laser is governed by the spin of its exciton-polariton condensate, which can be controlled by external fields. The first optical spin switches based on semiconductor microcavities were realized by Amo and our coworkers in 2010, with gigahertz switching speeds. 5 A low-power continuous-wave laser primes the system in a ready state so that a little additional \u2018probe\u2019 laser light will switch on the polariton laser. Such spin switches are important building blocks for polariton integrated circuits, which would carry information as domains of spin-polarized exciton-polaritons. Polariton integrated circuits would have an advantage of lower energy losses and faster information transfer compared to conventional electronic circuits. \n \nFor the terahertz radiation application, we recently proposed vertical-cavity surface-emitting terahertz lasers based on polariton lasers. 6 Emission of terahertz radiation would be stimulated by a condensate of exciton-polaritons in these devices. Unlike many other types of terahertz laser, this design does not require a waveguide or a laser cavity for terahertz photons, allowing the whole structure to be microscopic. Tuning of the emission frequency may be achieved by shifting the optical excitation beam on the surface of a graded microcavity. Tunable terahertz lasers have wide areas of application in medicine, communication technologies, and security. \n \nPolariton lasers will bring fundamental effects of many-body quantum physics to our everyday life. Their unique physical properties make them suitable for novel types of spin switches and terahertz lasers, which have many applications. The most promising materials for polariton lasing are the wide-band-gap semiconductors GaN and zinc oxide (ZnO), which allow for room-temperature action. We are working toward commercialization of polariton lasers. The next milestones along that path are the experimental demonstration of an electrically pumped polariton laser, the realization of polarization modulators and amplifiers based on polariton lasers, and demonstration of vertical-cavity terahertz lasing. \n \n This work has been supported by the Royal Society and the European Union IRSES (International Research Staff Exchange Scheme) project POLAPHEN (Polarization Phenomena in Quantum Microcavities). \n \n \n \n \n \nAlexey Kavokin \nSchool of Physics and Astronomy \nUniversity of Southampton \n \nSouthampton, UK \nand \nCharles Coulomb Laboratory \nUniversity of Montpellier 2 \n \nMontpellier, France \n \n \nAlexey Kavokin received his PhD at the Ioffe Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1993.

Until recently, active\nelectronics using solid-state technologies were unable to access sub-MMW\nfrequencies directly due to insufficient transistor performance. The compromise\nelectronic option was to use frequency conversion to multiply circuit operating\nfrequencies up from millimeter wave frequencies. Such an approach limited the\noutput power level of the devices and the achievable signal-to-noise ratio. It\nalso restricted the devices to relatively large sizes in terms of footprint and\nweight. These limitations and restrictions prevented widespread implementation\nand the subsequent exploitation of the sub-MMW frequency band. The enabling\ntechnology necessary to exploit the sub-MMW band is monolithic microwave\nintegrated circuits (MMICs) that will operate up to THz frequencies. These THz\nMMICs or TMICs, require THz transistors with maximum oscillation frequencies\n(fmax) well above 1 THz. \n \n The\nobjective of the Terahertz (THz) Electronics program is to develop the critical\ndevice and integration technologies necessary to realize compact,\nhigh-performance electronic circuits that operate at center frequencies\nexceeding 1.0 THz. The program will focus on the developments of two critical\nTHz technical areas. \n \n Terahertz\nTransistor Electronics. The program will aggressively develop multi-THz InP HBT\nand InP HEMT transistor technologies to enable TMICs. In addition, THz low-loss\ninter-element interconnect and integration technologies will also be developed\nto build compact THz transmitter and receiver modules. \n \n Terahertz\nHigh Power Amplifier Modules. Compact, micromachined vacuum electronics devices\nwill be developed to produce a significant increase of output power at\nfrequencies beyond 1.0 THz and to radiate this energy at an antenna. \n The success of the THz Electronics program will lead\nto revolutionary applications by enabling coherent THz processing techniques\nsuch as THz imaging systems, sub-MMW, ultra-wideband, ultra-high-capacity\ncommunication links and sub-MMW, single-chip widely-tunable synthesizers for\nexplosive detection spectroscopy.

M\u00fcnzenberg \n \n \n \nIn spin-based electronics, information is encoded by the spin state of electron bunches. Processing this information requires the controlled transport of spin angular momentum through a solid, preferably at frequencies reaching the so far unexplored terahertz (THz) regime. Here, we demonstrate, by experiment and theory, that the temporal shape of femtosecond spin-current bursts can be manipulated by using specifically designed magnetic heterostructures. A laser pulse is employed to drive spins from a ferromagnetic Fe thin film into a nonmagnetic cap layer that has either low (Ru) or high (Au) electron mobility. The resulting transient spin current is detected by means of an ultrafast, contactless amperemeter based on the inverse spin Hall effect that converts the spin flow into a THz electromagnetic pulse. We find that the Ru cap layer yields a considerably longer spin-current pulse because electrons are injected in Ru d states that have a much smaller mobility than Au sp states. Thus, spin current pulses and the resulting THz transients can be shaped by tailoring magnetic heterostructures, which opens the door for engineering high-speed spintronic devices as well as broadband THz emitters in particular covering the elusive range from 5 to 10THz. \n \n \n Subjects: Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall) ; Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other) \n Cite as: arXiv:1210.5372 [cond-mat.mes-hall] \n  (or arXiv:1210.5372v1 [cond-mat.mes-hall] for this version)"], "link": "http://terahertztechnology.blogspot.com/feeds/2401170557815382637/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://4.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://arxiv.org/": 15, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Terahertz Technology"}, {"content": ["http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417412011335  \nLeila H.

Belkin \n Room-temperature terahertz (THz) quantum cascade laser (QCL) sources based on intra-cavity difference-frequency generation (DFG) with record THz conversion efficiencies is reported. THz DFG QCLs reported previously are highly inefficient since THz radiation produced more than ~100 &mu;m away from the exit facet is fully absorbed due to high THz losses in the QCL waveguide. Our lasers use a non-collinear \u010cerenkov DFG scheme to extract THz radiation from the active region. Dual-color mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers with integrated giant optical nonlinearity are grown on semi-insulating (S.I.) InP substrates. A lateral current extraction scheme is used. THz radiation is emitted at an angle into the substrate with respect to the mid-infrared pumps. Since S.I. InP is virtually lossless to THz radiation, this scheme allows for efficient extraction of THz radiation along the whole waveguide length. As a result, our sources demonstrate large mid-infrared-to-THz conversion efficiency and directional THz output. Experimentally, proof-of-principle devices demonstrate a conversion efficiency up to 70 &mu;W/W2 and provide output across a 1.2 - 4.5 THz spectral range.\u00a9 (2012) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Brown School of Engineering and former chair of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. \u201cIf it\u2019s inside a sealed package and the environment in that package changes because of contamination or aging or exposure to temperature, an inspector would see that sensor change from blue to red and know immediately the food is spoiled.\u201d \n \n \n \n Such visual cues are good, he said, \u201cespecially when you need to look at a lot of them. And you can read these sensors with low tech, either with your own eyes or a spectrophotometer to scan things.\u201d \n \n The films are made of nanoscale layers of hydrophobic polystyrene and hydrophilic poly(2-vinyl pyridine). In the liquid solution, the polymer molecules are diffused, but when the liquid is applied to a surface and the solvent evaporates, the block copolymer molecules self-assemble into a layered structure. \n \n The polystyrene molecules clump together to keep water molecules out, while the poly (2-vinyl pyridine), P2VP for short, forms its own layers between the polystyrene. On a substrate, the layers form into a transparent stack of alternating \u201cnano-pancakes.\u201d \u201cThe beauty of self-assembly is that it\u2019s simultaneous, all the layers forming at once,\u201d Thomas said. \n \n The researchers exposed their films to various solutions and found different colors depending on how much solvent was taken up by the P2VP layers. For example with a chlorine/oxide/iron solution that is not readily absorbed by the P2VP, the film is transparent, Thomas said. \u201cWhen we take that out, wash the film and bring in a new solution with a different ion, the color changes.\u201d \n \n The researchers progressively turned a clear film to blue (with thiocyanate), to green (iodine), to yellow (nitrate), to orange (bromine) and finally to red (chlorine). In each case, the changes were reversible. \n \n \n \n Thomas explained that the direct exchange of counterions from the solution to the P2VP expands those layers and creates a photonic band gap \u2014 the light equivalent of a semiconducting band gap \u2014 that allows color in a specific wavelength to be reflected. \u201cThe wavelengths in that photonic band gap are forbidden to propagate,\u201d he said, which allows the gels to be tuned to react in specific ways. \n \n \u201cImagine a solid in which you create a band gap everywhere but along a 3-D path, and let\u2019s say that path is a narrowly defined region you can fabricate within this otherwise photonic material. Once you put light in that path, it is forbidden to leave because it can\u2019t enter the material, due to the band gap. \n \n \u201cThis is called molding the flow of light,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days in photonics, people are thinking about light as though it were water. That is, you can put it in these tiny pipes. You can turn light around corners that are very sharp. You can put it where you want it, keep it from where you don\u2019t want it. The plumbing of light has been much easier than in the past, due to photonics, and in photonic crystals, due to band gaps.\u201d \n \n Co-authors of the paper are Rice research scientist Jae-Hwang Lee and MIT postdoctoral researchers Ho Sun Lim and Joseph Walish. \n \n The work was supported by the U.S. Army Research Office, the U.S. Air Force and the Korea Research Foundation, funded by the Korean government. \n \n \n \n About Rice University \n \n Located on a 300-acre forested campus in Houston, Rice University is consistently ranked among the nation\u2019s top 20 universities by U.S. News & World Report. Rice has highly respected schools of Architecture, Business, Continuing Studies, Engineering, Humanities, Music, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences and is home to the Baker Institute for Public Policy. With 3,708 undergraduates and 2,374 graduate students, Rice\u2019s undergraduate student-to-faculty ratio is 6-to-1. Its residential college system builds close-knit communities and lifelong friendships, just one reason why Rice has been ranked No. 1 for best quality of life multiple times by the Princeton Review and No. 4 for \u201cbest value\u201d among private universities by Kiplinger\u2019s Personal Finance.

Markelz  \n  \n We report the anisotropic terahertz response of oxalic acid and sucrose crystals in the 0.2-3.0 THz range using terahertz time domain spectroscopy on large single crystals. We compare the observed anisotropic response with the response calculated using solid-state density functional theory (DFT) and find good agreement in the orientation dependence and relative intensities of the crystal phonons. It was found that oxalic dihydrate can be reversibly converted to anhydrous by controlled relative humidity. In addition, oxalic acid was found to have a large birefringence with  n = 0.3, suggesting the material may be useful for terahertz polarization manipulation. Sucrose has a smaller birefringence of  n = 0.05, similar to that of x-cut quartz. The anisotropic measurements provide both mode separation and symmetry determination to more readily achieve mode assignment for the more complex sucrose spectrum."], "link": "http://terahertztechnology.blogspot.com/feeds/568965967002167048/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://4.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2, "http://pubs.acs.org/": 5}, "blogtitle": "Terahertz Technology"}]
