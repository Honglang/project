Available for purchase from the Timeplots site for $34.95. \n \n This large-scale (48\u2033x32\u201d) print is like nothing else available on the history of the U.S. House of Representatives. It depicts the progression in political ideology of every House seat from 1789 to 2010. Other highlights include a timeline of over 100 major legislative enactments and significant developments in U.S. legislative history, and visual summaries of party control and ideological distribution of the House and Senate in each Congress. A Visual History of the U.S. House of Representatives is packed with information and is not intended to be absorbed at a glance, but rather visited and revisited over time. \n \n The infographic design visualizes the entire history from 1789-2013. The main, central visualization is the unique highlight of this design. Each representative is shown by a colored circle that matches their party affiliation, and placed along a vertical scale based on their ideology. The circles are filled partially transparent, so you get the cumulative color effect when the circles overlap. This creates a darker color when many representatives within any particular two-year Congress share a similar ideology, and you can see clear areas of concentration. Fantastic new visualization method, and creates a beautiful image. \n   \n The poster also visualizes the balance of power for each two-year Congress by party, and compares it to the Senate and the President from the same time period. Major milestones, amendments, governance issues, economy, foreign affairs, civil rights and social policy achievements are also plotted within the time periods they took place. \n Nathaniel Pearlman, Founder and President of Timeplots, agreed to answer a few behind-the-scenes questions about designing the poster. \n \n Cool Infographics: What software applications were used to help analyze the data and create the design? \n Nathaniel Pearlman: So far we have programmed our information graphic prints in the R language and done the final design pass in Illustrator. I\u2019m interested in hearing about other platforms to use for complex data and layout \u2014 especially other software applications that would allow us to create interactive and print versions from the same code base. \n Cool Infographics: What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from the data? \n Nathaniel Pearlman: As with some of our other posters, I like the big picture: for me, the visual history of the U.S. house print shows the sweep of U.S. history \u2014 a marked contrast with the more journalistic, and immediate, take on the political and economic state of the nation that we are used to seeing in the news. You can clearly see the ebb and flow over time of ideological overlap between the parties \u2013 and how they are at such loggerheads now. \n Cool Infographics: What was the hardest part behind designing the House poster? \n Nathaniel Pearlman: For the House poster, it took us a while to come up with a compelling central graphic. We were looking for something visually arresting from a distance, but that captured the key patterns in the data. I think we found that. \n Cool Infographics: What should we expect in the future from Timeplots? \n Nathaniel Pearlman: We have recently launched Graphicacy, a design group that helps other tell their own stories with print or interactive information graphics, especially involving large or complex data sets. For Timeplots, we are currently working on a history of U.S. State boundaries and a visual history of baseball. I am excited about both of them. I would also love to hear from your audience what they would like to see, and we are always looking for collaborators, if someone would like to work with us on a project that they care about. We\u2019re open to new ideas! \n Cool Infographics: Who is your primary audience for the posters? Schools, businesses, political offices, individuals, etc.? \n Nathaniel Pearlman: Our primary audience is those with true interest in the subject matter. Our work is explanatory or educational art for smart people \u2013 and just about everyone has areas of intense interest, whether it is sports, entertainment, food, politics or finance. Timeplots has done a lot with American politics so far, but we intend to move now into other areas as well."], "link": "http://www.coolinfographics.com/blog/2012/10/26/a-visual-history-of-the-us-house-poster-and-interview.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://wig.bz/": 4}, "blogtitle": "Cool Infographics"}, {"content": ["Tracking American Poverty & Policy is an interactive infographic visualization site that breaks down the data about\u2026you guessed it\u2026poverty in America. \n The site provides a sequence of interactive pages that start with the overall poverty numbers, and then break them down in more detail by race, gender, education, age and family type.

The Sage Hill Difference has been used as a printed handout, a 7-foot retractable banner, a PDF available for download and the JPG image file online. The design is used to educate and inform prospective families, parents, students and the general public. \n \n  The Sage Difference: 7-foot retractable banner \n I asked Torrey Olins, the Director of Communications and Marketing at Sage Hill, some questions about designing and using the infographic as a marketing tool: \n \n Cool Infographics: What software applications were used to help analyze the data and create the design? \n Torrey Olins: The piece was created using InDesign. The data was collected and analyzed through a combination of resources from Sage Hill School and our advertising firm, O\u2019leary and Partners ( www.adagency.com ) The piece did not require any software for analysis of data. \n Cool Infographics: Who designed the infographic? \n Torrey Olins: The design of the infographic was a collaboration between myself O\u2019leary and Partners. About six months ago, I came up with the idea of creating an infographic for the school\u2019s marketing efforts in our fall 2012 admission season, and in fact, sent my account manager and her assistant links to coolinfographics.com for inspiration. We were unable to find any other high school that had created an infographic for marketing, so we ended up using elements from a variety of different sources. For example, the school history portion of the infographic was inspired by an infographic created to celebrate the history of a small city. \n Because O\u2019leary and Partners has been creating print and digital media for Sage Hill School for several years, they were able to apply our design look and feel (color palate, fonts, etc.) to this piece so that it integrates nicely with our other school communications, while also going in an entirely new direction. I did not want this piece to look like a \u201cone off\u201d and I was pleased that O\u2019leary accomplished my goal of creating an infographic that maintains continuity with our brand. \n Cool Infographics: Would you describe the different formats you published the infographic? \n Torrey Olins: The infographic was published as an 8.5\u201d x 25\u201d folded print piece that we hand out to prospective students and parents at high school fairs, our Admission Open House and other campus events. We also have a jpg and pdf copy of the infographic on our website ( www.sagehillschool.org ) and have published it on our Facebook ( www.facebook.com/sagehillschool ) and Pinterest accounts ( www.pinterest.com/sagehillschool ). We also reproduced the infographic on two large (7\u2019x3\u2019) retractable banners that we can bring to off campus events or use around campus (we currently have one in our lobby for visitors to see while they are waiting for appointments.) \n Cool Infographics: How has the use of the infographic and social media impacted your marketing and recruiting process? \n Torrey Olins: Sage Hill School is Orange County, California\u2019s premier independent, coed, nonsectarian high school. The school was founded in 2000 and currently enrolls 466 students in grades 9-12. Because Sage Hill School is located in a community that does not have as long of a history with independent schools as with the public school system, it is important for us to highlight the differentiators that make Sage Hill School the finest college preparatory option in our area. The infographic is an effective way to communicate the value of a Sage Hill education to the parent who is deciding whether to send a child to public school or pay tuition for Sage Hill School. \n The infographic format met my needs for a fresh approach to demonstrate the achievements and differentiators of Sage Hill School to prospective families, as well as reinforcing the value of the school for our currently enrolled families. We are very excited that Sage Hill School is one of (or possibly the first) high schools to utilize the infographic format for marketing in the 2012-2013 admission season! \n The recruiting season for independent schools typically begins in October and will last until admission decisions are announced and families sign contracts in the spring. Thus, it is quite early in the process and unfortunately, it is too soon for us to speak to increases in inquiries/ applications as a result of the infographic or other social media efforts. \n Cool Infographics: What has been the reaction and feedback to the infographic? \n Torrey Olins: Let\u2019s face it, facts and stats about schools can be extremely dry. For families who are considering a variety of different high school options, numbers and figures tend to run together. Thus far, both current and prospective families have indicated that the information in the infographic is presented in a way that is interesting, fun and memorable. \n As a school in our second decade, Sage Hill has established a reputation for innovation in our educational program; this year we are pleased to educate families about Sage Hill School through the use of an innovative communication tool. We are also excited that this piece has put Sage Hill School\u2019s name out in the broader community as an institution that is eager to embrace new media, both inside and beyond the classroom. I have been contacted by a number of other independent schools who are interested in using this format for their marketing as well. \n \n \n Thanks to Torrey for taking the time to share their process and reaction to using the infographic!"], "link": "http://www.coolinfographics.com/blog/2012/10/22/the-sage-hill-difference-marketing-infographic-interview.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://coolinfographics.com/": 1, "http://www.adagency.com/": 1, "http://www.sagehillschool.org/": 5, "http://www.pinterest.com/": 1, "http://www.facebook.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Cool Infographics"}, {"content": ["Fast Fourier Transforms: A Study Guide from Tektronix is a great example of using data visualization and infographic design principles to visually explain the math behind their oscilloscopes. \n \n Most engineers don\u2019t remember the complex algorithms and concepts of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) that they learned in college.

In response to its passing, Master of Public Health.org created The Price of Socialized Medicine: Obamacare\u2019s Unconstitutionality by the Numbers infographic to give insight into how it will affect everyone. \n \n The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, in a landmark 5-4 decision. Unfortunately, they got it wrong. The PPACA, known colloquially as Obamacare, should have been struck down by the high court, as it is both unconstitutional and very costly: \n \n Individual Mandate : Obamacare requires that all Americans carry health insurance or face an annual penalty. The federal government is effectively compelling individual citizens to enter a market, which is a clear violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court ruled that this was constitutionally valid as within Congress\u2019 taxing power. \n Medicaid Expansion : As the original Act is written, the PPACA would require states to expand Medicaid support or risk having their entire Medicaid federal funding cut off. This infringes on states\u2019 rights. Fortunately, the Supreme Court did rule against these sanctions. \n \n In response to the ruling, we have produced an infographic titled, \u201cThe Cost of Socialized Medicine: Obamacare\u2019s Unconstitutionality by the Numbers\u201d, which illustrates the folly of the PPACA as well as some of the costs that will be borne as a result. \n \n Obviously, this design is promoting a specific opinion, but we\u2019re here to discuss the infographic design itself. \n \n The design outlines a really good step-by-step story top-to-bottom, and summarizes the data behind their point of view clearly \n Good mix of illustrations and data visualization within each section. \n In general, there\u2019s WAY too much text in the design.

Some are larger than they should be, and a couple are smaller. Almost like the sizes were eye-balled instead of calculated mathematically. Odd. \n The states that have filed lawsuits would be easier to understand if the colored states were still placed within the map of the U.S. \n Good list of sources \n Need a copyright statement and the URL to the original infographic landing page for readers that find the infographic posted on the Internet to be able to find the original. \n \n Thanks to Jimmy for sending in the link!"], "link": "http://www.coolinfographics.com/blog/2012/10/11/obamacare-the-price-of-socialized-medicine.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://masterofpublichealth.org/": 2, "http://masterofpublichealth.amazonaws.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Cool Infographics"}, {"content": ["Building a Global Visual Language from The Noun Project on Vimeo . \n The Noun Project is beauty in its simplicity. \n I post this video for two reasons: \n \n Even though there are no statistics in the video, I do consider this to be an infographic video.

This informative infographic shares the results of custom research from SEOmoz , and was designed by AYTM . \n \n How much does SEO cost? How much time do you have to discuss the various models and prices out there! However, a new survey sheds some light on the subject. \n Over 500 people and companies who offer search engine optimization services were asked about how their models. Turns out, it\u2019s most common to charge $100 to $150 per hour, in the US. But by-the-hour consulting is only one of four nearly co-equal ways of charging. \n Also popular is project-based pricing, where the average price is between $2,500 to $5,000, in the US.

Fixed prices on a contract basis is also a popular way that SEO is sold, but no averages were provided. \n The survey was conducted by SEOmoz and compiled into the infographic below by AYTM : \n \n From a design standpoint, there are a lot of things I like about this infographic. \n The consistent columns for regions of the world make the layout very easy to follow.

Since this was custom primary research, I have no way to validate the data visualizations without seeing the data, and that reduces the credibility of the entire design.

My biggest complaint is their use of legends in a few sections. In those charts, the colors are visually hard to differentiate, and the reader has to work very hard to understand which pie slice or bar goes with each color. This is only a problem in the Agency Type and Common Client Types sections. The rest do a good job of connecting the data labels directly to the visualization. \n The footer should include some type of copyright statement, and the URL for readers to find the original infographic landing page. \n Found on Visual Loop"], "link": "http://www.coolinfographics.com/blog/2012/9/26/how-much-does-seo-cost.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://searchengineland.com": 1, "https://aytm.com/": 2, "http://visualoop.tumblr.com/": 1, "http://www.seomoz.org/": 1, "http://searchengineland.com/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Cool Infographics"}]
