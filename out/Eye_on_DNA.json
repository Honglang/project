Because critics say that an immigrant like Keflezighi who moved to the U.S. at age 12 isn\u2019t a legitimate American. \n A post on Letsrun.com said: \n Give us all a break. It\u2019s just another African marathon winner. \n \n How about making that African- American ? \n Silly me. I thought that naturalized American citizens equal American citizens at birth with the same rights and privileges (with the exception of getting to be the President of the United States). Leaving that debate aside, however, the belief that East Africans are genetically endowed for marathon running has also clouded Keflezighi\u2019s celebration. \n The success of distance runners from Kenya and Ethiopia has fostered a lore of East Africans as genetically gifted, unbeatable, dominant because of their biology. Scientists have looked for \u2014 but not found \u2014 genes specific to East Africans that could account for their distance ability, said John Hoberman, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies race and sports. \n \n Truly American? Debate Dogs a Triumph in the Marathon \u2013 NYTimes.com \n No doubt Keflezighi has genes which enhance his physiological capabilities for endurance and other traits found in winning marathoners. This does not mean that Keflezighi is any more or less American than other non-East African runners who have the same genes. \n The Oxford English Dictionary defines \u201cnationality\u201d in two parts: \n nationality \n noun (pl. nationalities ) 1 the status of belonging to a particular nation. 2 an ethnic group forming a part of one or more political nations. \n \n Even though ethnic groups are mentioned, the U.S. is clearly a country of many ethnic groups so genes should not be part of the debate when discussing whether someone is American or not. \n Quite frankly, I\u2019m not even sure what makes a person American and I don\u2019t think anyone else does either. I hold an American passport and spent the years between ages 6 and 26 in the U.S. I\u2019ve lived in six different countries in the past 10 years and as a result, my national identity is slightly muddled. My son is even more confused. He holds an American passport as well but has never lived in the U.S although he\u2019s lived in four different countries in his seven years. He was born in Japan so some days he says that he\u2019s Japanese and now that he lives in Singapore, he sometimes says he\u2019s Singaporean. I\u2019m sure some people would say he\u2019s not American at all. \n It might be simpler to say we\u2019re global citizens with ties to more than one country. Truth be told, I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m Chinese-American with the accent to prove it. \n Edited to add this video of Meb Keflezighi on David Letterman:"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/EyeOnDna/~3/8nlOqKLN5G8/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.askoxford.com/": 1, "http://www.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://www.eyeondna.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Eye on DNA"}, {"content": ["A little over two years ago, I confessed that I was \u201c just a little scared of genetic testing .\u201d I have two young children and almost every day I see traits in them that I\u2019m pretty sure they inherited from me whether via genes or behavior. If you\u2019re a parent, I\u2019m sure you can imagine that there\u2019s a lot of self-blame going on in our house. \n So when it comes to genetic testing, I should want to know but I don\u2019t.

Bayout admitted in 2007 to stabbing and killing Walter Felipe Novoa Perez in Italy. During the first sentencing, he was found to be mentally ill. This year, neuroscientists also found abnormalities in brain-imaging scans and five genes linked to violent behavior, including MAOA . \n Although there have been numerous cases since 1994 in which the defense argued for leniency based on MAOA deficiency, this is the first case in which this tactic has been successful. Based on the scans and genetic testing results, the judge reduced Bayout\u2019s sentence by another year. \n Not everyone agrees with the judge\u2019s decision. \n \"We don\u2019t know how the whole genome functions and the [possible] protective effects of other genes,\" says Giuseppe Novelli, a forensic scientist and geneticist at the University Tor Vergata in Rome. Tests for single genes such as MAOA are \"useless and expensive\", he adds. \n \n Even worse, this verdict could open the floodgates to claims of all sorts the more we know about genetic influences on behavior.
