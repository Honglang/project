It\u2019s a good illustration of how our DNA can tell us about our interconnectedness. \n The piece shows it\u2019s not \u201csix degrees\u201d that separates these individuals from each other, but, in all but one case, no degrees of separation. This means that these individuals are all directly related to one another, albeit in most cases distantly. This was also news to the 15 participants. \n All but one of the individuals has Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. The one exception is Linda Chavez, the political commentator, who descended from Conversos, indivduals of Jewish and Muslim ancestry who converted to Catholicism during the Inquisition. Her ancestors eventually settled in New Mexico. But even in her case, although she isn\u2019t directly related to any of the group, she is connected to each of the others individuals focused on in the piece by just one other individual in the 23andMe database. \n The connections shown in the article are what prompted The New York Times columnist David Brooks and NPR \u201cAll Things Considered\u201d host Robert Siegel to joke about learning they were distant cousins, sharing a common ancestor several generations back. Brooks kidded that he was \u201cmost surprised that our ancestors worked together on National Schetl Radio, on a program called \u2018All Pogroms Considered.\u2019\u201d (Maybe the line needs a drum roll to work.) \n The article shows the genetic connections between people like Mayim Bialik, the actress on the Big Bang Theory, and Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics. Or the connections between NPR\u2019s Siegel, and Harvard Law professor, Alan Dershowitz, or his connections to 23andMe\u2019s CEO\u2019s mother Esther Wojcicki, a journalist and teacher. The magazine shows the connections and the amount of shared DNA, measured in centimorgans (cMs), to illustrate the \u201crelatedness\u201d of any two individuals. More closely related individuals share more DNA. \n So why is all this interesting? \n It is a very specific example of unexpected connectedness. We\u2019ve written about this interconnectedness before . We\u2019ve even seen unexpected connectedness among 23andMe employees . Even in cases with people who have vastly different backgrounds and experiences, one can use genetics to create a short chain of people to connect any two individuals to each other.

You\u2019d probably talk to relatives about your family medical history. \u00a0You\u2019d likely visit your doctor and maybe a specialist. \u00a0You might even change your diet and exercise routines. Arnab Chowdry did all that and more. Arnab worked with other researchers to uncover the biological ramifications of the genetic mutation he carries and is presenting the findings at a national meeting of geneticists. \n Arnab is a Senior Manager of Platform R&D at 23andMe and recently discovered he carried a variant in the MYBPC3 gene that is associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) . \u00a0This was sobering news; HCM is most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes by thickening the heart muscles and interfering with blood flow. As he has blogged about, his particular genetic mutation is considered a \u201cvariant of unknown significance.\u201d That is just another way of saying the scientists don\u2019t know very much about it.

Alzheimer\u2019s is an important topic among 23andMe customers so naturally they asked for more information about the variant. \n After a review of the research,\u00a0 we recently released a new Preliminary Research report on Alzheimer\u2019s that covers this rare protective variant. The report is considered preliminary because the finding still needs to be confirmed by the broader scientific community. While our report is preliminary and only a very small number of people have this protective variant, the research is interesting nonetheless because of what it may say about the disease. \n The variant is not found in the APOE gene, which is the most well-established genetic risk factor for the disease. (23andMe\u2019s Established Research report on Alzheimer\u2019s estimates genetic risk for customers with European ancestry based on variants of the APOE gene known as e2, e3, and e4.) Rather, the variant is located in a gene called APP. Rare mutations in APP are known to cause familial and early-onset forms of Alzheimer\u2019s, but this particular variant is associated with lower risk for the disease. The study was done on more than\u00a0 3,000 people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and about 9,000 people over the age of 85 without the disease. All of the participants were from Iceland. The results showed that the T version of rs63750847 \u00a0\u2014 also known as the A673T variant in the APP gene \u2014 was associated with about five times lower odds of Alzheimer\u2019s. \n \n Loading\u2026 \n \n <> \n This is a very rare variant with only one person in 10,000 of European descent having the variant. But the finding is very intriguing to researchers and drug-makers. The disease-causing mutations in the APP gene lead to an overproduction of beta amyloid protein in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s. The protective variant appears to do the opposite, according to the study. New drugs built on this finding could help protect against Alzheimer\u2019s, or even the mental ravages of normal aging. \n Previous posts related to Alzheimer\u2019s disease: \n\u2022 World Alzheimer\u2019s Day \n\u2022 Genetics and the Risks from Traumatic Brain Injuries \n\u2022 SNPWatch: Do These Genes Make My Brain Look Big? \n\u2022 23andMe Launches Health Report on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease \n\u2022 Studies Identify Five More Genetic Variants Associated with Alzheimer\u2019s"], "link": "http://blog.23andme.com/health-traits/a-genetic-variant-protective-against-alzheimers/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nature.com/": 1, "https://www.23andme.com/": 4, "../health-traits/big-questions/gauging-the-risks-of-traumatic-brain-injuries-with-genetics/": 1, "../health-traits/news/announcements/23andme-launches-health-report-on-alzheimers-disease/": 1, "../health-traits/23andme-research/snpwatch/snpwatch-do-these-genes-make-my-brain-look-big/": 1, "../health-traits/world-alzheimers-day/": 1, "../health-traits/23andme-research/snpwatch/studies-identify-five-more-genetic-variants-associated-with-alzheimers/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The 23andMe Blog"}, {"content": ["The Genetic Alliance , a nonprofit health advocacy organization, is asking for support to expand people\u2019s right to their own health information by giving them direct access to their clinical laboratory test results. \n 23andMe supports this position and several of our employees are signing-on to a letter the organization has put together advocating the rule change. If you agree, we\u2019d like to encourage you to sign as well. \n Here\u2019s a few reasons why: \n We believe people need quick and convenient access to test results so they can better manage their own health. We believe people should have the same right to access \u00a0their lab results as they do to their other medical records. And we believe that by giving people a simple way to access these records, it will improve the level of care and produce better health outcomes. \n This proposed change is a long time coming. About a year ago, 23andMe submitted comments along with more than 150 others to the Department of Health and Human Services about a proposed federal rule change ( CMS-2319-P ) that amends the current quality standards that are part of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 \u2014 known as CLIA. The change specifies that, upon a patient\u2019s request, the laboratory must provide access to completed test reports. \n These changes are part of a series of reforms governing access and privacy around health records. About a dozen years ago, changes were first made that gave people access to their health information. Another change made a few years later gave people the right to obtain those records electronically, but because of a fluke in overlapping regulation, the rules didn\u2019t apply to laboratory test results. \n In addition to that rule, another related to Medicare and Medicaid only permitted the release of lab results to \u201cauthorized persons,\u201d a term that doesn\u2019t include patients themselves. The proposed change will correct these quirks in the law and give people the access to all their health records. \n Beyond the fact that a person should have the right to their own health information, there are a lot of other very good reasons for access. We\u2019ve mentioned a few already, but the Genetic Alliance\u2019s detailed letter gives plenty more including: saving money by avoiding redundant testing; giving patients the ability to quickly access this information in an emergency; and preventing harm by informing people of issues they might not have learned without access to their test results. \n We invite anyone else who supports this guarantee for access to their clinical laboratory test results to sign on.

Although we\u2019ve been around for awhile, many people, particularly in Washington, just don\u2019t know about our research model or understand what is so different about it.

During the briefing, held at the House of Representatives\u2019 Visitors Center in September, Anne gave a quick primer on 23andMe\u2019s unique research platform and in particular our Parkinson\u2019s research initiative , now the largest Parkinson\u2019s community for genetic research in the world. \n Working with the Muhammad Ali family, the Michael J. Fox Foundation and others 23andMe has created an engaged community that has quickly helped to make breakthroughs, including finding two new genes associated with Parkinson\u2019s. \n During her presentation, Anne quoted Haydeh Payami, a New York State Department of Health neurodegenerative disease researcher, who said our research model could significantly accelerate disease research. \n \u201cWhat 23andMe did in a matter of years would have taken several decades and tens of millions of dollars\u201d if done conventionally, she said . \n The visit to D.C. offered a chance to explain how our research model engages individuals and allows them to come together, share information and participate in research. The model has accelerated the pace of research and engaged people in the process. \n \u201cPeople want to help each other,\u201d and participate in research, Anne said.

Like family health histories, genetic testing also offers people insights they otherwise might not have about their own health. \n Unfortunately there has often been a false division between family health histories and genetic testing where the approaches are portrayed as opposing alternatives. We\u2019ve written about this before here and here . It\u2019s an odd argument. No one would juxtapose the utility of a stethoscope against a thermometer. They are both useful in their own way. \n A new paper in PLoS Genetics by 23andMe shows that neither family health histories nor genetic testing is perfect in predicting health risks, but they each have their strengths. \n More importantly using them together improves upon the risk prediction by capitalizing on the situations where each method is at its strongest. Along with making comparisons between family health history and genetic testing to make risk prediction, the paper describes a model to combine the two methods together to assess risk. \n Lead author and 23andMe scientist Chuong \u201cTom\u201d Do, Ph.D, worked with our senior medical director Uta Francke, MD, and scientists David Hinds, Ph.D., and Nicholas Eriksson Ph.D. to make a comprehensive comparison of family health histories and genetic testing to assess risk for 23 different conditions. \n \u201cWe show that family history is most useful for highly common, heritable conditions,\u201d Tom said. \n So for relatively common diseases that may have many genetic and environmental factors \u2014 coronary artery disease, for instance \u2014 knowing that your father had the disease is helpful at predicting whether or not you might be at risk for the same condition. \n But for less common diseases with many genetic factors influencing them, knowing your family history seldom helps in making a risk prediction, said Tom. \n In part, that\u2019s because these diseases are uncommon enough that they would rarely show up in the health history of your immediate family. When family histories are uninformative, genetic testing may still reveal the genetic variants that would put you at a higher or lower risk for the condition. So for example Crohn\u2019s disease might not show up in a family history, but the risk prediction from a genetic test is relatively strong. As an aside there is also the issue of people who simply don\u2019t know their family health history. And we\u2019ve written about how genetic testing can alert them to risks they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise suspected. \n To be fair, even though new genetic discoveries are being made every day, only a fraction of the genetic contributions to whether or not a person develops a disease is currently known in many cases. But even after accounting for this, existing genetic testing \u2014 that use single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based methods to determine risk for some rare complex diseases \u2014 are already as good at predicting risk as family histories for common heritable conditions. \n \u201cThese results indicate that for a broad range of diseases, already identified SNP associations may be better predictors of risk than their family history-based counterparts, despite the large fraction of missing heritability that remains to be explained,\u201d Tom writes in the paper. \n Finally, it\u2019s important to remember that having a family history for a disease is generally not the same as a diagnosis. Just because your mom had diabetes doesn\u2019t mean that you will get it too. \u00a0But knowing that you\u2019re at increased risk based on family history can be a motivating factor in helping you to make appropriate lifestyle changes. \u00a0In much the same way, knowing your genetic risks can also be useful in helping you live healthier."], "link": "http://blog.23andme.com/23andme-research/using-genetics-and-family-history-for-health/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://spittoon.23andme.com/": 1, "http://blog.23andme.com/": 3, "http://www.plosgenetics.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The 23andMe Blog"}, {"content": ["Dave Hinds is a Principal Scientist in Statistical Genetics.\u00a0 \n 23andMe is passionate about research on a group of rare blood disorders called myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs.

We recently reached our goal of enrolling 1,000 individuals into our MPN Research Initiative and are excited about the discoveries that are possible with such an amazing program. \n Some of the first discoveries stemming from this initiative will be presented at the upcoming American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) conference, this year hosted in San Francisco. \n 23andMe scientist David Hinds * will present results from a web-based study aimed at discovering new genetic variants associated with MPNs. In the first nine months after launching our study, 800 individuals with an MPN diagnosis supplied DNA by simply spitting into a tube. Although larger groups of patients are usually needed to produce meaningful results, we were still able to replicate known associations between inherited variants in the JAK2 gene and forms of MPN known as \u201cJAK2 V617F-positive MPN\u201d. (These genetic variants are reported to 23andMe customers in our MPN Preliminary Report ). \n \n \n Participate in Research \nThe results presented in this post demonstrate that web-based participation can contribute to genetic research for rare diseases, which are usually difficult to study because so few individuals have them. 23andMe offers a variety of ways for people with and without rare diseases to contribute to research \u2014 all it takes is a little bit of spit and the willingness to answer web-based questionnaires.
