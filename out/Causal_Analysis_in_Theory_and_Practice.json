As I understand it, if we assume linearity, we regress Y on W and X and take the coefficient on W, call it b; then we regress W on X and take the coefficient, call it a; the causal effect is ab*x. \n However, I wonder if we are (unavoidably) in a situation where X is a near-instrument for W, so that we will have a ton of bias. \n Thanks for your help! \n Randy \n Judea replies: \n Randy, \nThe danger of conditioning on an instrument or a near instrument only exists when we have some residual, uncontrolled bias. In our case, the W\u2014>Y relation is completely deconfounded by conditioning on X, therefore, no bias-amplification can take place. The danger will resurface if there was a bi-directed arc between W and Y. \n An important nuance: The capacity of an instrument to introduce bias where none existed (demonstrated in my paper) only pertains to situations where the zero bias is unstable, i.e., created by incidental cancellations. For example, if we had a bi-directed arc between W and Y that happened to cancel the bias created by the confounding path W Y, then the crude (regressional) estimate of the effect of W on Y would be unstably unbiased, and conditioning on W would introduce bias. \n In general: The bias amplification phenomenon never conflicts with the rules of do-calculus. \n Thanks for raising this question. \n ======Judea"], "link": "http://www.mii.ucla.edu/causality/?p=426", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Causal Analysis in Theory and Practice"}, {"content": ["Dear colleagues in causality research, \n This is a Winter Greeting from the UCLA Causality blog, welcoming you back to a discussion on causality-related issues. \n This message contains \n 1. Topics under discussion \n 2. New results \n 3. Information on journals, lectures, conferences, and software. \n   1. Topics under Discussion \n \n 1.1 Principal Stratification \u2013 A goal or a tool?\u2019 \n  http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r382.pdf \n  http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4xj9d380#page-3 \n Was posted for discussion in the International Journal of Biostatistics (IJB) in March 2011, and has elicited response from eight discussants on whether studies based on Principal Stratification estimate quantities that researchers care about. \n I am about to wrap up the discussion with a summary-rejoinder, so, if you have comments or insights that where not brought up, feel free to communicate them to the IJB\u2019s Editor, \u201cNicholas P. Jewell\u201d or/and, if you wish, cross-post them on this blog. \n 1.2 Comments and Controversies: \nWe are being warned again that graphical models can produce \u201cincorrect\u201d causal inferences. The warning comes again from Lindquist and Sobel (LS), entitled \u201cCloak and DAG\u201d: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911013085 \n A response to L&S is posted on our causality blog, proving them wrong, and questioning the wisdom of asking researchers to translate assumptions from a language where they stand out vividly and meaningfully into an Arrow-Phobic language where they can no longer be recognized, let alone justified. We have all the reason to suspect that L&S will come back. \n 1.3 The Match-Maker Paradox \nAn apparent paradox concerning the representation of matching designs in DAGs was posted by Pablo Lardelli and resolved by noting that matching involves unit-to-unit interaction and results in \u201cpersistent-unfaithfulness.\u201d \n 1.4 An On-going Causal-Inference Discussions on SEMNET (Structural Equation Modeling Discussion Group \nIn the past four months I have spent time discussing modern approaches to causal inference with SEM researchers who, by and large, are still practicing the traditional methods associated with the acronym \u201cSEM\u201d. The discussions are fully documented and archived on http://bama.ua.edu/archives/semnet.html \n Topics include: \n  a. the causal/statistical distinction. \n  b. the structural-regressional distinction \n  c. The residual/disturbance distinction \n  d. The assumptions conveyed by each structural equation. \n  e. The counterfactual reading of structural equations \n  f. What the Mediation Formula tells us about mediation and policy questions. \n  g. Mediators and Moderators. \n  h. d-separation, equivalent models and the testable implications of structural models \n  i. The logic of SEM as an inference engine. \n Additionally, a weekly session is being conducted by Les Hayduk, going page by page over the R-370 chapter ( http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r370.pdf ) and explaining it to novices in the field. It answers, I hope, all questions that rank and file researchers find perplexing when introduced to causal analysis. \n 1.5 Draft Chapter on Causality and SEM \nKen Bollen and I finished a draft chapter titled \u201cEight Myths about Causality and Structural Equation Models.\u201d It covers the history of misconceptions about SEM, including recent assaults by the Arrow-Phobic Society. \n see http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r393.pdf \n 1.6 A Survey Paper on Adjustment \nGreenland, S., and Pearl J., \u201cAdjustments and their Consequences \u2014 Collapsibility Analysis using Graphical Models\u201d http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r369.pdf \n The paper teaches researchers how to glance at a graph and determine when/if an adjustment for one variable modifies the relationship between two other variables. It is a simple exercise for graphical modellers but extremely difficult one for economists and other researchers who ask such questions routinely and have no graphs for guidance. \n 1.7 A New Introduction to Causal Calculus \nAn excellent introduction to causal diagrams and do-calculus was posted recently by bloggist-author Michael Nielsen, titled \u201cIf correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation, then what does?\u201d It can be accessed here: http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/if-correlation-doesnt-imply-causation-then-what-does/ \n My response, together with thoughts on the psychology of Simpson\u2019s Paradox is below http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/guest-post-judea-pearl-on-correlation-causation-and-the-psychology-of-simpsons-paradox/ \n 1.8 Haavelmo and the Emergence of Causal Calculus \n http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r391.pdf \n Presented at Haavelmo Centennial Symposium, in Oslo, last December, the paper describes the cultural barriers that Haavelmo\u2019s ideas have had to overcome in the past six decades and points to the fact that modern economists are still unaware of the benefits that Haavelmo\u2019s ideas bestow upon them. \n 2. New Results in Causal Inference \n 2.1 Interpretable Conditions for Identifying Natural Direct Effects. \n http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r389.pdf \n The paper lists four conditions that are sufficient for the identification of natural direct and indirect effects. The conditions do not invoke \u201cignorability\u201d jargon thus permitting more informed judgment of the plausibility of the assumptions. It also shows that conditions usually cited in the literature are overly restrictive, and can be relaxed without compromising identification. \n 2.2 Some Thoughts on Transfer Learning, with Applications to Meta-analysis and Data-sharing Estimation \n http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r387.pdf \n Summary: How to combine data from multiple and diverse environments so as to take full advantages of that which they share in common. \n 2.3 Understanding Bias Amplification \n http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r386.pdf \n This note sheds a new light on the phenomenon of \u201cbias amplification\u201d by considering the cumulative effect of conditioning on multiple \u201cnear instruments,\u201d and shows that bias amplification may build up at a faster rate than bias reduction. \n 2.4 Local Characterizations of Causal Bayesian Networks \nby Bareinboim, Brito and Pearl http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r384.pdf \n The standard definition of Causal Bayesian Networks (CBN) requires that every interventional distribution be decomposable into a truncated product, dictated by the graph. This paper replaces this \u201cglobal\u201d definition with three alternative ones, each invoking \u201clocal\u201d aspects of conditioning and intervening. \n  3. Journals, Courses, Lectures and Conferences \n  3.1 Tutorial: Causal Inference in Statistics \n \nI will be giving a tutorial (IOL) on causal inference at the upcoming JSM 2012 conference in San Diego California, July 29th, 4-5:50 PM.
