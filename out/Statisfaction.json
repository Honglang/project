I\u2019m going to work mostly with Ajay Jasra on Sequential Monte Carlo theory and methodology. NUS seems like the perfect place to work long hours: there\u2019s space, whiteboards, printers, air conditioning, food courts and even a gym. There\u2019s also a bunch of very prestigious statisticians here but I still don\u2019t know how much interaction I can expect with them. I still plan to blog here about conference, papers, software, etc. \n It seems like a good time to give my final impressions about getting a PhD in France, before I forget. All in all, I can\u2019t complain about my personal case: it was a wonderful time for me, mostly thanks to Xi\u2019an . \n \n However my case is pretty rare, and many other PhD students I\u2019ve met often were feeling stressed about their job and sometimes thought about quitting (or did it). The main reasons seemed to be: \n \n the late discovery that the topic of the PhD is stupid / not fruitful / outdated; \n the development of personal hostility between the student and his/her advisor; \n the student realizes that he/she wants to have an easier life than what universities have to offer, either in terms of salary of in terms of working hours/holidays. \n \n It seems to me that points 1. and 2. are hard to predict and to avoid for undergrad students applying for PhD. The only thing to do is to get in touch with former PhD students of the targeted PhD advisor, if any. Also make sure that you\u2019re applying for a place that hosts various talented and benevolent researchers, so that if your advisor turns out to be a dick difficult to deal with, you can rely on other people. Point 3. is avoidable by grabbing a minimum amount of information about academic careers, which are always kind of similar regardless of the field of research. Indeed I was once astonished to hear from a desperate PhD student that he thought getting a PhD was supposed to be easy. Why not investigating a bit before committing to a +3 years job? \n To be fair I think France is a pretty good place to do a PhD, because people have a lot of liberty in their research and not a lot of counterproductive pressure (compared to the US for instance). After the PhD, academic positions in France are not very attractive with a lot of teaching and not a lot of money (at least there\u2019s still not a lot of pressure but that\u2019s currently changing for the worse), which is why a lot of young French academics move abroad after the PhD\u2026 like me! \n Next time I\u2019ll blog about statistics, for a change!"], "link": "http://statisfaction.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/new-job-same-blog/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://robinryder.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://xianblog.wordpress.com/": 3, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.edu.sg/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Statisfaction"}, {"content": ["Hello, \n This blog is not dead! And it\u2019s gonna get more active soon. \n These last few days, a workshop on Sequential Monte Carlo methods was held in the University of Warwick ( link to the webpage ). It was a very exciting meeting, efficiently organised by Arnaud Doucet , Adam Johansen , Anthony Lee and Murray Pollock and hosted by CRiSM . For those who couldn\u2019t attend, here\u2019s a little summary of my experience (or more exactly, just a bunch of links). Since SMC methods are at the core of my research, I was logically interested by all the talks (which is exceptional for 3 days of workshop, filled with 30 talks!). It was probably a good time for a workshop on SMC, since there\u2019s a lot of recent activity in the field. My impression is that this renewed interest is mainly due to: \n \n the Particle MCMC framework, which inspired other algorithms (like our SMC^2 that Nicolas Chopin presented, or the Particle Gibbs with ancestral sampling ), renewed interest in the normalising constant estimate in particle filters, and more generally made it possible to estimate parameters in a broad class of time series models with plenty of diverse applications ( probably more than 200 citations already ); \n theoretical advances, with recent papers from Pierre Del Moral , Nick Whiteley , Ajay Jasra , and many others; \n a new class of exact algorithms for simulating continuous time processes without any discretisation error, based on sequential importance sampling, in a fascinating work by Paul Fearnhead , Krzysztof \u0141atuszy\u0144ski and colleagues. \n parallel computing, including the recent GPU trend, which makes SMC all the more attractive compared to purely iterative algorithms like MCMC. \n \n The last point was illustrated at this workshop by a recent work from Alexandre Bouchard-C\u00f4t\u00e9 and colleagues called \u201cEntangled Monte Carlo\u201d, as well as by my own presentation: I talked about a new resampling scheme that avoids global interactions between all the particles, and resorts only to multiple pair-wise interactions. This is an on-going work with Pierre Del Moral , Anthony Lee, Lawrence Murray and Gareth Peters , that I might talk about again with more details in the future! \n Cheers!"], "link": "http://statisfaction.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/recent-advances-in-sequential-monte-carlo-warwick-2012/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www2.ac.uk/": 7, "http://www.indii.org/": 1, "http://scholar.google.com/": 1, "http://www.ac.uk/": 4, "http://arxiv.org/": 5, "http://www.u-bordeaux1.fr/": 1, "http://www.crest.fr/": 1, "http://nips.cc/": 1, "http://www.ubc.ca/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Statisfaction"}, {"content": ["Hello, \n Following my previous post on e-readers , where I was pretty enthusiastic about it, I feel compelled to tell the sad ending of this story.

It was hosted at the Goldney Hall (picture above). It turned out to be a succession of fascinating talks about the recent developments and the future of statistical methods used in very challenging inference problems. What I appreciated above all was the ambition of many talks, and the generosity of the speakers in giving many ideas to the audience. \n Among the things I\u2019ve learned there, the following were the most ambitious in my opinion. \n \n \n Scott Schmidler from Duke gave an introductory presentation of how complexity is defined and analysed in computer science, classifying the problems in terms of the time needed to solve them in the worst case (polynomial or exponential?). The main message there was: don\u2019t spend too much time trying to solve a problem that computer scientists already classified as \u201cimpossible\u201d, and use some tools from computer science to analyse the difficulty of statistical inference problems. \n In another analogy, Christian L. M\u00fcller from ETH Z\u00fcrich gave a talk comparing recent optimization methods (like variable-metric algorithms) with adaptive MCMC; they\u2019re similar methods even though they\u2019re expressed in different terms, and the efficiency assessments are necessarily quite different (sampling from a distribution is not exactly like finding the maximum of its probability density function). In this analogy, he proposed to think about benchmark test suites for sampling problems, just as there are test suites for optimization problems. That could be very nice, since many articles already used very similar problems, e.g. mixture models, banana-shape distributions, etc. as toy examples illustrating multi-modality and ridges in the target distribution. \n Sebastian Reich from Universit\u00e4t Potsdam gave a talk about the links between sampling problems and optimal transport in measure theory, which are related to Bayesian optimal maps and implicit particle filters . It\u2019s mainly about alternatives to standard Monte Carlo (e.g. importance sampling) when \u201cmoving\u201d a sample from distribution f_1 to distribution f_2, relying on deeper arguments connecting two closely-related probability distributions, but still at an experimental level in practice from what I understood. Probably something to keep a careful eye on! \n C\u00e9dric Ginestet from King\u2019s College London presented a poster about Fr\u00e9chet means , and his results on the topic (see here and here for his articles). The idea is that on a general metric state space some classic results in statistics can be extended (for instance to test the difference between two means ); it sounds purely theoretical, but it\u2019s actually driven by many applications: your data can not only consist in numbers but also in images, trees, networks (for instance the data describing patient in a hospital). Then how to define a mean? To what does the mean converge when the sample size grows? How to test the difference between two groups? \n Geoff Nicholls from the University of Oxford gave a very inspiring talk on variations of the Metropolis\u2013Hastings when the target density function cannot be evaluated point-wise. In this setting, the pseudo-marginal approach applies when one can get unbiased estimates of the density; Nicholls deals with the case where one can get (essentially) normally distributed estimates of the log density (instead of the density itself), relying on recent articles in the physics literature. This could lead to massive improvements in applications where the data set is very large and log likelihood can be written as a sum of independent terms (such as for many regression models). Really looking forward to see the forthcoming paper on this! \n \n I can\u2019t get into too much details since it\u2019s mostly unpublished work, but I just wanted to give an overview for those who couldn\u2019t attend the workshop. \n Pierre"], "link": "http://statisfaction.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/awesome-bristol/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.duke.edu/": 1, "http://www.pnas.org/": 1, "http://www.ac.uk/": 5, "http://arxiv.org/": 4, "http://jcp.aip.org/": 1, "http://people.ethz.ch/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2, "http://users.uni-potsdam.de/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Statisfaction"}, {"content": ["In an invited contribution to the last ISBA Bulletin , Larry Wasserman discusses the\u00a0 \u201calmost 350 years old\u201d peer review system ( paper ).

It\u2019s an innovative model, which reminds me of MyMajorCompany . \n More about the project itself. Meta-analysis is the art of combining multiple, heterogeneous studies and aggregate them to get an overall answer to a given problem. It\u2019s especially popular in epidemiology: suppose that a lab has run a clinical trial on many people and that another lab has done a similar study in a different country, how does one combine both studies to get more precise results, while still taking into account the specificity of each study? Which study is contributing the most to the results? What differences are there between the two studied populations?\u00a0 Meta-analysis allows to answer such questions. Statistically speaking it usually amounts to some kind of hierarchical model , for instance a mixed model . \n Eva\u2019s project is about using this statistical machinery to assess the effectiveness of aid programs. It seems meaningful to me, because there might be many studies studying each particular aid program, but for the good Samaritan the problem is really about choosing who to give money to. Meta-analysis seems able to help him out in this dilemma.
