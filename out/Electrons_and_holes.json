First, via Austin's imaging blog , a history of confocal microscopy at Biotechniques.com . At NanoLetters: \" Very Black Infrared Detector from Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanotubes and Electric-Field Poling of Lithium Tantalate \". From the abstract: Vertically aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes were grown by water-assisted chemical vapor deposition on a large-area lithium tantalate pyroelectric detector. The processing parameters are nominally identical to those by which others have achieved the \u201cworld\u2019s darkest substance\u201d on a silicon substrate. The pyroelectric detector material, though a good candidate for such a coating, presents additional challenges and outcomes. After coating, a cycle of heating, electric field poling, and cooling was employed to restore the spontaneous polarization perpendicular to the detector electrodes. The detector responsivity is reported along with imaging as well as visible and infrared reflectance measurements of the detector and a silicon witness sample. We find that the detector responsivity is slightly compromised by the heat of processing and the coating properties are substrate dependent. However, it is possible to achieve nearly ideal values of detector reflectance uniformly less than 0.1% from 400 nm to 4 \u03bcm and less than 1% from 4 to 14 \u03bcm. And finally, seen at Nature Photonics , an open access paper at the Virtual Journal for Biomedical Optics: \" Wavefront image sensor chip \". The abstract reads: We report the implementation of an image sensor chip, termed wavefront image sensor chip (WIS), that can measure both intensity/amplitude and phase front variations of a light wave separately and quantitatively. By monitoring the tightly confined transmitted light spots through a circular aperture grid in a high Fresnel number regime, we can measure both intensity and phase front variations with a high sampling density (11 \u00b5m) and high sensitivity (the sensitivity of normalized phase gradient measurement is 0.1 mrad under the typical working condition). By using WIS in a standard microscope, we can collect both bright-field (transmitted light intensity) and normalized phase gradient images. Our experiments further demonstrate that the normalized phase gradient images of polystyrene microspheres, unstained and stained starfish embryos, and strongly birefringent potato starch granules are improved versions of their corresponding differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope images in that they are artifact-free and quantitative. Besides phase microscopy, WIS can benefit machine recognition, object ranging, and texture assessment for a variety of applications."], "link": "http://electronsandholes.blogspot.com/feeds/6884102580166947804/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://austinblanco.com/blog": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 1, "http://pubs.acs.org/": 1, "http://www.opticsinfobase.org/": 1, "http://www.biotechniques.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Electrons and holes"}, {"content": ["A recent paper at the open access Sensors Journal : \" Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor Photodetectors \".

Our commitment to the advancement of BSI technologies is second to none. As the first company to commercialize the use of this technology, our first generation OmniBSI pixel is already in mass production and has begun to ramp significantly in fiscal 2011 and serves as the basic for our entire 5-megapixel product line. With the advancement of BSI-2, the second generation OmniBSI pixel, we have further expanded our leadership in pixel technology well ahead of our competitors. The second generation BSI architecture represents a major milestone in digital imaging technology in an aggressive form factor. Meanwhile, most significantly, these technologies serve the basic for meeting the trend towards ever higher pixel counts and establish a trend towards high quality pixel. Another notable commitment enduring in core sensing technology is our CameraCube technology development. In particular, we remain focused on the development of advanced wafer level optics and packaging solutions for our next generation products and reduce product costs. To this end, we are consistently examining our options and look for solutions to achieve our goal. Last, but not least, through fiscal 2010, our OmniPixel3-HS technologies continued to gain traction with broad market acceptance due to its leading low light sensitivity. Our latest high performance VGA sensor that is built with our popular 3.0 micron OmniPixel3-HS high sensitivity pixel is well accepted in automotive and the security markets, which also demand high definition color applications. [...] Currently, a major trend and expectation in imaging is the increasingly rapid marketplace adoption of high sensitivity, high definition images and video. [...] Our BSI products are proven to be a key differentiator that has enabled OmniVision to secure a range of high value customers and projects. We expect that our proprietary BSI technology will continue to be a decisive factor in securing further design wins during the next several quarters resulting in an increasingly prominent position within our vertical target markets. [...] In regards to technology of BSI, obviously to ship the quantities that we are shipping today, it\u2019s a long learning curve. We regard that as extremely a big advantage to OmniVision, and our competitors will probably face that step when they get to it. And it\u2019s not easy to ship the volumes we have. [...] We have been developing the backside illumination technology with our strategic partner TSMC for many years. This has been a five-year effort for us. And there has been a tremendous amount of intellectual property developed between the two companies in that process. And that\u2019s very hard to reproduce and is very hard to reproduce in a short time period. So if you look at our success and the growth we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s really been fueled by BSI.

The first one is \" eLeNA: A Parametric CMOS Active-Pixel Sensor for the Evaluation of Reset Noise Reduction Architectures \". The abstract reads: We present a novel complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) active-pixel sensor imager that incorporates different reset schemes to achieve lower reset noise levels. The sensor, eLeNA, features a 448 $times$ 512 array with a pixel pitch of 15 $muhbox{m}$, fabricated using a 0.18- $muhbox{m}$ CMOS process. Fourteen sections and five different reset methods were employed. Without using pinned diodes, we implanted structures for correlated double sampling. A noise of 6 $hbox{e}-$ is measured with a conversion gain of 49 $muhbox{V/e}-$. We will discuss various applications for the reset method that achieved the best overall performance, considering leakage current and read noise. The second one is: \" Simulation and Measurements of Stray Minority Carrier Protection Structures in CMOS Image Sensors \". The abstract reads: Recently, the rapid growth of CMOS technology has made it possible to integrate more periphery circuits into a CMOS image sensor. Although these periphery circuits improve image quality, they also lead to the generation of more stray minority carriers. Because the number of stray minority carriers is proportional to the frequency, the affected region increases with increasing operating frequency. Placing an appropriate absorber between the periphery circuits and the pixel has traditionally been accepted as the best solution for this issue. Four protection tactics were simulated in software and verified in a fabricated CMOS image sensor. The imager was fabricated using TSMC 1-poly 6-metal 0.18-$muhbox{m}$ process technology. On this chip, ten noise sources outside the pixel array were used to verify the effectiveness of the protection tactics in off-array tests, whereas in-pixel noise sources were used in in-pixel tests. To quantify the influence of stray minority carriers in the off-array test, the maximum depth of an affected region (DAR) was measured in a processed binary image. The off-array experimental results revealed that the DAR increased with either an increased operating frequency or a decreased separation between the noise source and the pixel array. The DAR of the affected pixels can be eliminated up to 48.1% and 23.8% by using the N-well and N-diffusion guard rings, respectively. The in-pixel experimental results have shown that the N-diffusion digital pixel implementation reduced the noise by 63.2% while only increasing the area by 10.68%. Detailed information about the effectiveness of different protection tactics in an imager design was collected in this paper. This paper can potentially provide a reference to help imager designers choose an appropriate protection tactic. And the third one: \" Per-Pixel Dark Current Spectroscopy Measurement and Analysis in CMOS Image Sensors \". The abstract reads: A per-pixel dark current spectroscopy measurement and analysis technique for identifying deep-level traps in CMOS imagers is presented. The short integration time transfer gate subtraction experimental technique used to obtain accurate results is described and discussed. The activation energies obtained for molybdenum (\u22480.3 eV), tungsten (\u22480.37 eV), and the phosphorus-vacancy (E-center) (\u22480.44 eV) trap levels in silicon match published results measured with other techniques. The Meyer\u2013Neldel Relationship (MNR) was observed between the Arrhenius preexponential frequency factor and activation energy. The trap capture cross-sectional calculation methodology using the MNR is presented. The cross sections of molybdenum, tungsten, and the E-center were calculated as \u22481 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm2, \u22481.5 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm2, and\u22482.5 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm2, respectively, at 318 K. The data obtained suggest electric field enhanced emission, and Poole-Frenkel barrier force lowering of E-center defects occurs in the pinning implant regions. It is proposed that a changing Fermi level results in the correct activation energies being obtained below half the band gap and that the dark current measurement process is affected by the measurement time result of statistical mechanics. It is also tentatively suggested that, in this case, the observed MNR is a geometric relationship and not due to a physical process. In case the abstract is a bit confusing, the authors conclude that: \"The measurement and analysis technique presented could be useful to the image sensor industry for diagnosing fabrication plant contamination. It also has potential applications for the study of radiation induced traps in CMOS and CCD imagers.\""], "link": "http://electronsandholes.blogspot.com/feeds/2993411651037581014/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/": 4}, "blogtitle": "Electrons and holes"}, {"content": ["New paper at Applied Physics Letters: \" Organic heterojunction photodiodes exhibiting low voltage, imaging-speed photocurrent gain \".
