Blog Twelve Mile Circle\u2019s article on the most state-tudinous 24-hour road trips, which I\u2019ve tweaked and expanded into this all-encompassing route across America: \n \n Altogether, that\u2019s a pleasant 6,813 mile drive , starting at South Berwick, Maine and ending in Taft, Montana, and passing, if ever so briefly, through each of the remaining Lower 48 states and the District of Columbia. \n \n Up for it? First, score a used box truck on Craigslist. Next, cut some windows through the sides, bolt in a bed and a fridge, and wire for sound. Then, with promises of one helluva rolling party, recruit a team of like-minded comrades. Now, tank full and fridge stocked, you\u2019re ready to cover some asphalt. \n Average 55 mph with stops, swap in fresh drivers as necessary, and you\u2019ll traverse every member of the contiguous U.S. in just under 124 hours. \n To complete the fifty, you\u2019ll need to bag Alaska and Hawaii. Curb the truck at Spokane and fly a three-legged loop to Honolulu, Anchorage, and back, which adds about 36 hours , including layovers, for a total travel time of: \n Just under one week: 160 hours, or 3.2 hours per state. \n That\u2019d be an awesome achievement, and about as fast as us little people can do it. \n However, if you\u2019re that someone special, like Mitt Romney \u2013 who can bounce to the Caymans on a whim and wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in the back of a box truck \u2013 the modern miracle of corporate jet travel opens a frontier far beyond the highway-addled imagination of the unwashed masses. \n \n You see, Mittens doesn\u2019t need to arrive two hours before his scheduled flight. With a chortle, he glides past the cattle queue at the airport Rent A Wreck. And, this morning, his secretary wired orders to the Bain Capital logistics hit squad: \u201coptimize Big Willard\u2019s next trip for speed.\u201d \n Now, she confirms, all the resources are in place: two Learjet 45s , working in tandem \u2013 one for the current hop, and the other to fly ahead and be ready for the next \u2013 and a limousine pre-positioned at each of his twenty airstrip stops, to whisk him to neighboring states in fully-stocked ( if unquaffable ) minibar style. \n Romney\u2019s route mirrors the proles\u2019, except that flyovers replace the mind-numbing intrastate parts. Cruising at 460 knots, his pilots deftly retire the 6200 air miles in just 11.7 hours, and at fifteen over the speed limit, his drivers navigate the 440 road miles in 6.3 hours. Add ten minutes per takeoff and landing, and 14 hours for the chartered Alaska-Hawaii Boeing 737, for a total of: \n 39 hours, or 47 minutes per state. \n \u201cNot bad for new money,\u201d booms a charismatic voice from on high.

The exact details are classified, but the jet can sustain Mach 1.6 and the helicopter 150 knots, so if we add five minutes to touch down and fully enjoy each state, it\u2019ll take a total of: \n 18 hours, or 21 minutes per state. \n Every member of the union in a single day, with six hours to spare! And, going into November, Obama can toss off a sonic boom or two \u2013 oops! \u2013 to shatter a few windows and show those pesky Red States who\u2019s boss. \n It\u2019s good to be King on vacation."], "link": "http://www.datapointed.net/2012/08/fastest-route-to-visit-all-fifty-united-states/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/": 1, "http://www.howderfamily.com/blog": 1, "http://abcnews.go.com/": 1, "http://mormon.org/": 1, "https://www.google.com/": 1, "http://www.baincapital.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 6, "http://api.tweetmeme.com/": 1, "http://goo.gl/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Data Pointed"}, {"content": ["Here at Casa Von Worley, when fresh data strolls though the door, the first thing I do is test its mettle \u2013 with a quick-n-dirty visualization.

Two years ago, I\u2019d crowned it as San Francisco\u2019s \u2013 and possibly the world\u2019s \u2013 steepest. But now, online chattered a successor to the throne: Hawaii\u2019s Waipi\u02bbo Valley Road , which reputedly cascades 900 vertical feet to the Pacific at a maximum grade of 45%! Impressive\u2026 except that you can\u2019t believe everything you read on the Internets. So, last month, I grabbed my digital level, boarded a 747, flew to the Big Island , and motored over to Waipi\u02bbo, in the interest of truth. \n West out of quaint Honoka\u02bba , the road rolls gracefully through pasture and rainforest. Sure, it\u2019s a bit hilly. But extreme? No way. Did I miss a turn somewhere? Then, ten miles in, after a particularly worrisome run of flatness, the faint hum of tourists, a parking lot, and the pavement dives into a giant gash. I\u2019d reached the rim of the Waipi\u02bbo Valley, and it was all downhill from here: \n \n Per the signage, by law, only bona fide four wheel drive vehicles can proceed. No AWD allowed. Always the good citizen, I curbed my wimpy rental SUV, unpacked my level, and walked over the lip. \n By any measure, the Waipi\u02bbo Valley Road is steep: you might say damn steep, extremely steep, or even butt-ass f*cking steep , depending upon your particular level of refinement and color commentary. It averages a 26% grade \u2013 descending 900 vertical feet over two thirds of a horizontal mile \u2013 and long sections tilt at a sustained 30% plus. In general, for whatever reason, photos don\u2019t do steep streets justice, but here\u2019s one anyways: \n \n As I descended, gravity urged: \u201cRun, roll, slide to the bottom!\u201d But that might hurt. So, instead, I carefully checked my acceleration with every step. Five minutes in, perspiration began to bead on my forehead. Walking downhill, the constant effort required to arrest my fall was making me sweat!  \n Along the way, I measured the instantaneous pitch with my digital level: 36%, 33%, 37%, 39%\u2026 and nothing steeper, anywhere, top to bottom. \n Now, back to San Francisco, the median grade of the northwest quarter of Bradford Street\u2019s tiltiest slab , as surveyed by Yours Truly, last November: \n \n Yes, that\u2019s a slope of 42.8% . Take a deep breath, Bradford, because in the kingdom of wheelbase tilt \u2013 how much your car would pitch, axle-to-axle, while driving up or down the road without any monkey business \u2013 you\u2019re still the Big Kahuna . \n Now, please permit me to veer off topic and dish a few niblets of Kona (leeward Big Island) wisdom: \n \n Shaka : Like the Californian hang-loose sign, but with back of hand towards the recipient. Meaning: hey braddah , right on, thanks, etc. If you\u2019re a tourist and get a shaka from a local, you\u2019re doing it right. \n Luau : Tried the Royal Kona version. Leis, fire, swords, poi, pork, and mai tais. Serviceable portrayal of Pacific Island dances. Pleasant with a hint of shlock. Recommended. \n Accommodations : Relative to Waikiki , main town Kailua is cute and undespoiled, but I refuse to bed down anywhere within walking distance of a Bubba Gump\u2019s Shrimp Company. To get off the tourist grid, travel 15 miles south to Captain Cook and the low-frills Manago Hotel . No TV in the rooms! \n Driving : Big Island is Big . But surely, I canz haul ass on the \u201cBelt Highway\u201d ? Bzzzt! Even the slightest curve in the road means 45mph, tops. Any attempt to not slow down and feel the aloha will be met by a stinky Datsun pickup, limping just off your front bumper. \n Snorkeling : We snorkeled Kona\u2019s most popular sites: Kealakekua Bay (incredible variety of sea life), Honaunau\u2019s Two Step (spinner dolphins), and Kahalu\u02bbu (fish-bowl-style shallows). The young lava shoreline means many holes, fingers, slots, arches, cracks, tubes. Go before 9am to avoid crowds and near-entry gridlock. Equipment: dry snorkel with a purge valve, water shoes, fins. Visit a dive shop to find a mask that fits right. Cover your back with sunscreen or shirt. After you\u2019ve \u201cgotten your feet wet\u201d, try the more adventurous options. \n Helicopter : \u201cYou don\u2019t appreciate the full scale of the eruption until you see it from the air,\u201d says my wife. And the electric lava sloshing in the two-hundred-foot-wide bathtub atop Pu\u02bbu \u02bb\u014c\u02bb\u014d crater\u2026 beyond words. We flew Safari Helicopters out of Hilo, but next time, I might try Blue Hawaiian . \n Luggage : Departing the Bay Area, our two bags weighed 92 pounds total. On the return, the same stuff tipped the scales at 108 pounds. The difference: damp, sandy clothes and gear? Dunno, but to avoid the onerous overweight fees, pack an extra bag, just in case. \n Island Fever : Primary symptom: distant, removed stare, manifesting hourly upon return to the mainland. \u201cI think Steve\u2019s in Hawaii again.\u201d \n \n Aloha!"], "link": "http://www.datapointed.net/2012/04/steepest-streets-hawaii-waipio-valley-big-island/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.yelp.com/": 1, "http://www.safarihelicopters.com/": 1, "http://www.managohotel.com/": 1, "http://www.bluehawaiian.com/": 1, "http://www.shorediving.com/": 1, "http://mapper.acme.com/": 1, "http://www.to-hawaii.com/": 1, "http://www.letsgo-hawaii.com/": 1, "http://www.tripadvisor.com/": 1, "http://www.hawaiihighways.com/": 1, "http://www.kona123.com/": 1, "http://www.datapointed.net/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 8, "http://api.tweetmeme.com/": 1, "http://www.curbsideclassic.com/": 1, "http://www.gohawaii.com/": 1, "http://www.urbandictionary.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Data Pointed"}, {"content": ["Is California headed into a drought?

Check the chart, and you\u2019ll find that the years which finished wettest share one thing in common: none started out unusually dry.

Go to a polling place, grab a ballot, and mark your favorite candidates in order of preference, one, two, three. First choice is Abraham Lincoln, of course. Second choice, Betsy Ross. Third choice, Winston Churchill. San Francisco elections are pick three, so you\u2019re done. Bask in the warm glow of civic duty. \n But don\u2019t bask long, because it\u2019s time to tabulate!

Repeat the process until finished. \n In our hypothetical four-way election, suppose the first choices break out 40% Ross, 36% Lincoln, 18% Churchill, and 6% Gandhi. Gandhi is lowest, so he\u2019s eliminated, and his supporters\u2019 second choices split between Lincoln and Churchill. So, going into Round 2, we have 40% Ross, 39% Lincoln, and 21% Churchill.

Honest Abe wins with a 53% majority. \n Now, ramp that up to 16-candidate Frisco, and you get the tabular thicket of numbers pictured above. \n In the interest of clarity, Burrito Justice tweeted : \n Thanks! Hey @datapointed, time to apply the crayola chart methodology! RT @McClure_SF: @burritojustice http://www.sfelections.org/results/20111108/data/mayor.html via @kevinmonty\n \n Great idea! Then, I whipped up a few drafts which didn\u2019t go anywhere, and, at that point, I shoulda stopped. But Se\u00f1or Justice had me hooked\u2026 \n So, using the official San Francisco mayoral election data (as of November 17th), we calculated the trajectory of each ballot: the sequence of candidates that it counted towards in each round of the tabulation process. Next, we eliminated the trajectories for ballots with no valid choice. Then, we rendered each as a fixed-thickness horizontal line, colored by candidate, first round left to last round right. Finally, we stacked them to create a chart where the vertical axis represents the overall fraction of the voting pool. \n Here are the trajectories, sorted most common first: \n \n At the top, we see the purple and medium blue of winner Ed Lee and runner-up John Avalos . A first choice of either of those two counted for them all the way through. Next is the bright cyan of Dennis Herrera, dark blue for David Chiu, cream for Leland Yee, and so on. To decode the colors, click through to the large version , which has labels for the major candidates. \n The same trajectories, grouped by first choice: \n \n The bars along the left side show the initial preference by candidate. And\u2026 Newsflash! San Francisco isn\u2019t completely colorblind; note the flow of votes along ethnic channels, especially from Herrera to Avalos and Chiu to Lee. \n And to wrap it up, let\u2019s sort by final result: \n \n To the right, we see Lee over Avalos, and large slug of dark gray, representing the trajectories which had no choices left in the race. These exhausted ballots \u2013 27% of the total cast \u2013 ended up not counting. That being said, in a sixteen candidate torture test, ranked choice voting trounces the traditional plurality system , which would have degenerated into a government-sponsored festival of wasted votes. \n Nevertheless, the \u201c27% exhausted\u201d figure bothers me, so I have to ask: \n Is there a fairer way to deal with the insane variety of San Francisco politics? A ranked choice primary to narrow the field, followed by a ranked choice runoff? \n Let\u2019s take a vote. \n Footnote: (*) Technically, in San Francisco, in each tabulation round, the most popular candidate who has more votes than the total for all less popular candidates is determined, and the votes of these less popular candidates are redistributed simultaneously. Typically, one candidate\u2019s votes are redistributed in each round, except in Round 4 of this election, in which four candidates votes were redistributed."], "link": "http://www.datapointed.net/2011/11/san-francisco-mayoral-ranked-choice-election/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.mayoredlee.com/": 1, "http://avalosformayor.org/": 1, "http://api.tweetmeme.com/": 1, "http://sfelections.org/": 3, "http://www.datapointed.net/": 6, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2, "http://www.sfelections.org/": 1, "http://www.burritojustice.com/": 1, "http://twitter.com/": 4}, "blogtitle": "Data Pointed"}]
