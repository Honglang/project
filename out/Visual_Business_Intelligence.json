Uttered from the lips of technology companies, including analyst organizations such as Gartner, the term Big Data remains ill-defined. This is intentional. It allows them to claim just about anything they want because their claims can\u2019t be fact-checked if you don\u2019t actually know what Big Data is. \n Generally speaking, technology companies use the term Big Data to refer to greater volumes and new sources of data. This, however, is not a new thing. Since the advent of computers, each year we\u2019ve accumulated more data and new data sources. Data didn\u2019t suddenly become big. Big Data is just more of the same, but it is celebrated by technology vendors, analyst groups, and thought leaders as a qualitative break from the past\u2014the newest techno-panacea that everyone must invest in or be left behind. Claims of Big Data\u2019s effects on the world are growing ever larger and more absurd. \n In his keynote presentation at Gartner\u2019s IT Expo last week in Orlando, SVP and Global Head of Research Peter Sondergard proclaimed that by the year 2015 a total of 4.4 million jobs will be created worldwide to support Big Data. Not only that, but every new Big Data role in the U.S. (1.9 million by 2015) will create jobs for three more people outside of IT. What does this actually mean? What constitutes a Big Data role? Because the term is so vaguely defined, Gartner can claim that any new job in an IT department or for people who work elsewhere with data in any way is in fact a new Big Data position. This is pure fantasy. \n And how did Gartner come up with the 4.4 million job figure? My guess is that, after a long night of drinking, they gathered around the Ouija board and let the spirits (that is, their own drunken imaginations) lead them to the answer. \n Notice the irony. Here is an organization of industry analysts talking about analytical technology that is engaging in analytical nonsense . No qualified data analyst would make such absurd and groundless predictions. Either the so-called analysts at Gartner have never been trained in data analysis or they are fabricating predictions that serve their own financial interests. Most likely, it\u2019s both. CIOs who buy into these prognostications are either na\u00efve or are, like Gartner, motivated by self-interest. After all, chasing the latest technology is what keeps CIOs employed. \n Organizations all over the world rely on groups such as Gartner to guide their IT investments. Are they getting objective and reliable advice? Far from it. Gartner has no incentive to discourage organizations from investing in IT. They make their money by keeping us convinced that we can\u2019t live without the latest technologies, regardless of whether they\u2019re actually needed or actually work. The truth is, analyst organizations such as Gartner are in bed with the very technology vendors whose work they supposedly monitor and critique. They\u2019re having a wild orgy in that bed, rolling in cash, but it is only the end users who are getting screwed. Essentially, Gartner and the like operate as extensions of technology company marketing departments. Gartner is creating demand for its clients\u2019 products and services (yes, the very technology companies that these analyst organizations monitor\u2014supposedly in an objective manner\u2014are their clients, who pay dearly for their support). These products and services aren\u2019t usually needed, they are often ineffective, and in the case of Big Data, they\u2019re ephemeral. Have you noticed that every business intelligence vendor has suddenly become the leading Big Data company without changing anything that they do? Just slap a new name on business as usual and you can get the world to line up at your door. \n Look past the marketing hype for analytical (data sensemaking) products that actually work. It doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re called Big Data, analytics, or just plain data analysis tools. What matters is that they help you find the signals that exist in the midst of all that noise in your data and make it possible for you to understand those signals and use that understanding to work smarter than before. Demand that vendors show you how their tools can be used to glean real value from your own data. Ignore their claims and demand evidence. Make them show you how you can make better decisions using their products and services. Unless they can provide that, you don\u2019t need what they\u2019re selling. \n Take care,"], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1428", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}, {"content": ["People who don\u2019t know how to manage performance or merely don\u2019t care tend to prefer dashboards (monitoring displays) that say little and do so poorly. This way they\u2019re never told anything they don\u2019t understand; they\u2019re never forced to get off their butts; they\u2019re never faced with a decision they can\u2019t or don\u2019t wish to handle. For such people, the illusion of control is not only sufficient, it\u2019s preferred over real control. \n Idiot lights and flashy dashboard gauges are great if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and don\u2019t care to learn. Idiot lights are those alerts that light up on your car dashboard to tell you that something\u2019s wrong. They assume, usually correctly, that you don\u2019t understand how the car works and couldn\u2019t handle more information beyond \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the engine; take me to the repair shop pronto.\u201d \n Most dashboard gauges are designed to look just like speedometers, fuel gauges, temperature gauges, etc., down to the annoying glare of light on glass. \n \n Do you know how much research went into determining that idiot lights and gauges that look just like those in our cars are the best way to display information on a dashboard for monitoring your organization\u2019s performance? The answer is zilch; none whatsoever. Back in the beginning when we started calling computer-based monitoring displays dashboards, someone had the bright idea of making display widgets that looked like those in cars. This is an example of taking a metaphor too literally. In the early days of cars, some of them included holders for horse whips, even though they were no longer needed. This seems absurd to us now, but it\u2019s no more absurd than assuming that information displays for monitoring the performance of your business should look like gauges on a car. The part of the \u201cdashboard\u201d metaphor that works is the similarity in function between car dashboard gauges, which we use to monitor information about the car and our driving, and monitoring dashboards, which we use to monitor information about the organization\u2019s performance. It is meaningless and downright absurd to stretch the metaphor any further. \n There\u2019s a term for aspects of design that emulate old-fashioned, physical objects that were used in a different context: skeuomorphs . In a recent article in Wired titled \u201c Clive Thompson: Retro Design is Crippling Innovation ,\u201d Thompson, an award-winning technology journalist, bemoaned the prevalence of skeuomorphs in modern software. Here\u2019s an excerpt: \n Despite being lauded for design, Apple is the reigning champion in this field, producing a conga line of skeuomorphs that are by turns baffling and annoying. Its iPhone app, Find My Friends, includes astonishingly ugly, faux stitched leather that wastes screen space. On the new iCal for the Macintosh, things are odder yet: when you page forward, the sheet for the previous month rips off and floats away, an animation so artless you\u2019d swear it was designed personally by Bill Gates. \n  \n As a Mac user, I too find paging through iCal annoying as hell. Thompson ends the article by completing the thought above: \n And if you really need to flip paper pages on your calendar? Buy a handmade one\u2014and hey, get some nice-quality pencils. Let paper work like paper and screens like screens. \n Skeuomorphs aren\u2019t all bad. There are times when they can be used, as N. Katherine Hayles explains, as \u201cthreshold devices, smoothing the transition between one conceptual constellation and another.\u201d You might argue that by making dashboard gauges look like those on cars, we\u2019re making it easy for people to use performance monitoring displays. It is certainly true that experience driving a car has already taught you how to read them. That would be a good argument if it took days or even hours to learn how to read more informative forms of display, but this is hardly the case. For example, a bullet graph , which was specifically designed for performance monitoring dashboards takes approximately one minute to learn how to read. One minute of learning is a small price to pay for a lifetime of better information more efficiently acquired. \n If you\u2019re good at your job and care about it, you want to be fully informed. You\u2019re not an idiot, so don\u2019t put up with dashboards that treat you like one. Demand the information that you need displayed to the level of your ability."], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1423", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.co.uk/": 1, "http://www.perceptualedge.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}, {"content": ["Yesterday morning I had a Big Data experience when I visited the Louvre Museum in Paris. Within 15 minutes of arriving I was ready to run screaming from the glass pyramid. Why? Because I was overwhelmed. Room after room of artistic works totaling in the hundreds of thousands, each magnificent, was too much. I found it nearly impossible to appreciate a single piece when I was surrounded by so many others. Pick any one of those glorious works and place it before me in a quiet room with good lighting and I would study it for hours. Give me something to read that describes the work\u2014the artist, the medium from which it was created, the historical context\u2014and I would appreciate it for an entire day. Place it among thousands of its brethren and I might fail to see it altogether. \n We are surrounded by data. In our present day of so-called Big Data, there is more and more of it every day. Anyone who has ever actually worked with data in an effort to make better decisions knows that most of the data that surrounds us is noise. It\u2019s useless. We seek the signals that reside here and there in the midst of the noise. While I stood there in the Louvre this morning, every piece of art was a masterpiece in its own right\u2014every piece a signal\u2014but to me they were all noise because there was too much for my senses to take in or my brain to fathom. Yes, even signals become noise when we\u2019re overwhelmed. I tried desperately to fix my attention on a single piece, but over and over again I failed. I couldn\u2019t shut out the other voices constantly invading my senses yelling \u201cLook at me!\u201d\u00a0 Yes, I saw the Mona Lisa with her enigmatic smile from behind the barrier while being jostled by the photo-taking crowd, but I couldn\u2019t connect with her or the genius of da Vinci, whose work I so admire. \n Others in the Louvre yesterday added the Mona Lisa and a host of other works to their lists of important encounters and no doubt felt enlarged by their experience. But were they enriched in a meaningful way? Did the artists\u2019 voices reach their ears through the din? Were they awakened or did they merely roll over in their sleep? \n Data becomes information only when it informs. For that to happen, we must find a signal in the midst of the noise and study it closely enough to understand it. This takes time. This takes attention. This takes skill. Only when this occurs has something useful entered our minds. \n Take care,"], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1417", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}, {"content": ["I was pleased and frankly surprised to receive 91 submissions to my dashboard design competition. Surprised because designing a student performance dashboard from scratch based on the data that I provided was not a trivial task. I was especially pleased to find a dramatic improvement over the general quality of entries since the last competition that I judged back in 2006. Almost every entry exhibited qualities that far surpass the dashboards that are typically produced and used today. I\u2019m grateful to everyone who took the time to participate. \n This competition served many purposes: \n \n To give dashboard designers an opportunity to test and further hone their skills. \n To provide me with many fresh examples of dashboards that were all designed to serve the same audience and purpose\u2014a teacher who needs to regularly monitor the performance and behavior of her students\u2014that I could include in the second edition of my book Information Dashboard Design. I now have a rich and varied set of dashboards that I\u2019ll use to demonstrate effective design and to illustrate common problems that still show up, even in dashboards that are created by experienced designers who take dashboard design seriously. \n To showcase examples of exemplar dashboards that could actually be used for an important purpose: to improve educational outcomes. \n \n All three purposes were well served by this rich and varied collection of entries. \n Now, let\u2019s get to the winners. Out of the 91 entries, I narrowed the list to the 8 and scored them using the following criteria: \n \n Each criterion was weighted according to importance, producing a total possible score of 100. \n At no time during the judging process was I aware of the competitors\u2019 identities. After scoring the top eight dashboards, to get a final reality check I sent them and a record of the scores to a couple of friends who both support better uses of data in schools. They both concurred with my judgment. \n Having finalized and double-checked the selection, I asked for the identities of the competitors. And the winner is Jason Lockwood. His dashboard received the highest score of 90.4 out of 100. This morning when I sent an email to Jason to congratulate him, I learned that he currently works as a usability and design consultant for IMS Health and is based in Switzerland. Although I didn\u2019t recognize Jason\u2019s name, he reminded me that he attended a data visualization course that I taught at IMS Health in London about two year\u2019s ago. Jason originally studied art in Canada. Here\u2019s his winning dashboard. \n \n(Click to enlarge) \n One of the first things you probably notice is its fine aesthetics. Its use of color, layout, and reduction of non-data-ink make it pleasing to the eye in a way that enhances usability. Because color has been used sparingly, the red alert icons make it easy to spot the students that are most in need of immediate attention (although the icons could be a little bigger to make them pop more). The tabular (rows and columns) arrangement of student information (one student per row) makes it easy to see everything about a particular student with a quick horizontal scan and easy to compare a particular metric across all students with a quick vertical scan. All of the most important metrics were consistently represented using the same dark shade of blue, which featured them above other items nicely (although the dark blue horizontal bars in the bullet graphs would have been easier to see and compare if they were thicker). This design is scalable in that the addition of more students could be easily accommodated by simply expanding the dashboard vertically. Meaningful patterns in individual student attendance information (days absent and tardy) can be easily seen. Rather than going on with my own description, which I\u2019ll elaborate in the new edition of Information Dashboard Design , I\u2019ll let Jason describe the work in his own words: \n 1 Introduction \n  \n In the course of my work as a UX engineer, I have the chance to try to bring good data visualization practices to my clients. However, many of the \u201cdashboards\u201d requested by those clients are closer to reporting solutions. Seeing this competition, I was delighted to be able to try my hand at a real dashboard. It was a very challenging and satisfying exercise, during which I learned a lot. I have designed this purely as a visual mock-up in Photoshop. I have the great luck of working with some very talented programmers who are incredibly adept of translating my mock-ups to pixel perfect, working solutions, which provides great freedom for me. This usually leads to small inaccuracies in the data portrayal, but I have taken extra care this time to ensure all the representations are accurate. \n 2 Overall design strategy \n  \n There is a lot of information contained within the data sheet, so one of the major challenges would be how to be able to display all of it in a clear way, on a single screen. I felt that all the information was pertinent to the goal of the dashboard, so did not want to exclude anything. That led to the compromise of designing to a slightly higher screen resolution of 1400px width than what perhaps may be standard. However, that being said, I have designed it in a way that on a SXGA monitor, the entirety of the student information would be visible, and the less important, class comparison information would be off screen. \n I usually base the overall colour palette on the visual identity of the client. As this was not provided, I invented the idea that the school colours were blue and grey. I would therefore use monochromatic shades of blue for data representation, grey for text and labels. For the background, I am using an off-white with a slight orange tint. This creates a subtle compliment to the blue, making the data stand out a little bit more. \n I chose Avenir as a font as it provides a good contrast between upper and lowercase letters for good legibility, as well as very clear numerals. With only a few exceptions (title and legends), I kept a 12pt font size to provide consistency. \n 3 Student data \n  \n Breaking down all the data in the excel sheet was an interesting exercise. First step was to prioritize the information. What would the teacher want/need to see first. I decided that the grades were crucial (that is, after all, the overall measurement of the student\u2019s performance). With the grades I grouped together the other pure assessment information: last 5 year assessments, last 5 assignments. The assignments completed late info provides a nice segue (and visual break) from scores to more behavioural information: Absences/tardies, Disciplinary referrals and detentions. \n I sorted the students by their current grade, from worst to best, so the teacher can view the problem cases first. Secondary sort is on difference from current grade from target. \n Having ordered the information, the next step was to visualize. The grades lent themselves very well to a bullet chart, efficiently portraying the target, current and previous scores. I used sparklines for the last 5 year assessment scores (being an interval axis), and micro-columns for last 5 assignments. For assignment late count (and later detentions and referrals) I used dots to represent the counts, as I find these are clearer to view than straight numbers. \n I chose to try to represent not only the amount of the tardies and absences but also their temporal occurrence. Hopefully this can allow the teacher to identify patterns not just for each student, but for the entire class. This ends up almost like a scatter chart. \n Last up for the behavioural data are the detentions and referrals, which again I represent as dots, with past term information in a lighter shade and to the left of the implied axis for comparison. \n Once all the student information was portrayed, I decide that some sort of aid was needed to help the user view the information in rows. I decided on zebra striping as I believe, while it is technically more non-data ink than row lines, it is clearer and subtler at the same time (a line has two edges, top and bottom, as does a solid box, but only half as many boxes are required). \n To compare the overall class performance to other classes/school/district, I combined the information from the summary tabs to create two graphs: a dot graph to show latest median assessment scores and percentage of students\u2019 assessment scores in percent groups. I chose a dot graph in order to emphasise the variation between the groups, but also to line up with the percentage groups of the second graph. \n On the second graph, I have unfortunately had to rotate the category labels. I would normally not do this, but I did not want to reduce the font any more (even reduced to 10pt, it would still be too crowded) or expand the screen any further. \n I finally added indicators on the student name to show English proficiency and special ed status, with the legend in the footer, along with the data qualification note. \n 4 Conclusion \n  \n Overall, I am quite pleased with the outcome of this design exercise. I believe I have managed to represent all the information in a clear and well structured way that would fulfill its user\u2019s needs. I have shown this to a couple teachers and received positive feedback (and requests to produce it). \n My only concern may be the colours: I design on a Mac and the colour fidelity is very good, however the subtleties sometimes disappear when viewed on less well-calibrated screens. This would be usually something we would fix during implementation, so hopefully it is not too bad here. \n Just like Jason, overall I am also quite pleased with this design. The primary improvement that comes to mind is the addition of more information in the right-hand section about the class as a whole, such as a frequency distribution of student achievement on course assignments. \n Congratulations to Jason Lockwood for exceptional dashboard design. \n In addition to our winner, I\u2019d like to showcase the runner up as well. The entry below was created by Shamik Sharma using Excel 2010. \n \n(Click to enlarge) \n Once again, notice the fine visual aesthetics of this design. Also notice the additional class-level information that appears on the right that doesn\u2019t appear in the winning dashboard, especially the two distribution graphs on top, which are quite useful. And finally, notice how the frequency distribution graph of assessment scores in the bottom right corner, which uses lines (called a frequency polygon) is easier to read than the one that uses bars (called a histogram) in the winning solution. A few features in this solution don\u2019t work as well, however, as those in the winning solution. For example, it isn\u2019t as easy to spot the students in need of attention, and per student attendance information is aggregated in a way that hides patterns of change through time. Overall, however, this is excellent work. \n I\u2019ll show many more examples of dashboards that were submitted in the new edition of Information Dashboard Design , both to illustrate useful design ideas and a few that didn\u2019t work. \n I invite all competitors who are interested in specific feedback about their designs to post them in my discussion forum on this site where I and others may appreciate them and offer suggestions. \n Take care,"], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1374", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog": 2}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}, {"content": ["I rarely agree to write promotional statements for books.

While it is true that a few new sources of data have emerged in recent years and that we generate and collect data in increasing quantities, changes have been incremental\u2014a matter of degree\u2014not a qualitative departure from the past. Essentially, \u201cbig data\u201d is a marketing campaign. \n Like many terms that have been coined to promote new interest in data-based decision support (business intelligence, business analytics, business performance monitoring, etc.), big data is more hype than substance and it thrives on remaining ill defined. If you perform a quick Web search on the term, all of the top links other than the Wikipedia entry are to business intelligence (BI) vendors. Interest in big data today is a direct result of vendor marketing; it didn\u2019t emerge naturally from the needs of users. Some of the claims about big data are little more than self-serving fantasies that are meant to inspire big revenues for companies that play in this space. Here\u2019s an example from McKinsey Global Institute (MGI): \n MGI studied big data in five domains\u2014healthcare in the United States, the public sector in Europe, retail in the United States, and manufacturing and personal-location data globally. Big data can generate value in each. For example, a retailer using big data to the full could increase its operating margin by more than 60 percent. Harnessing big data in the public sector has enormous potential, too. If US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year. Two-thirds of that would be in the form of reducing US healthcare expenditure by about 8 percent. In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than \u20ac100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data, not including using big data to reduce fraud and errors and boost the collection of tax revenues. And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus. \n If you\u2019re willing to put your trust in claims such as a 60% increase in operating margin, a $300 billion annual increase in value, an 8% reduction in expenditures, and a $600 billion consumer surplus, don\u2019t embarrass yourself by trying to quantify these benefits after spending millions of dollars on big data technologies. Using data more effectively can indeed lead to great benefits, including those that are measured in monetary terms, but these benefits can\u2019t be predicted in the manner, to the degree, or with the precision that McKinsey suggests. \n When I ask representatives of BI vendors what they mean by big data, two characteristics dominate their definitions: \n \n New data sources : These consist primarily of unstructured data sources, such as text-based information related to social media, and new sources of transactional data, such as from sensors. \n Increased data volume : Data, data everywhere, in massive quantities. \n \n Collecting data from new sources rarely introduces data of a new nature; it just adds more of the same. For example, even if new types of sensors measure something that we\u2019ve never measured before, a measurement is a measurement\u2014it isn\u2019t a new type of data that requires special handling. What about all of those new sources of unstructured data, such as that generated by social media (Twitter and its cohorts)? Don\u2019t these unstructured sources require new means of data sensemaking? They may require new means of data collection, but rarely new means of data exploration and analysis. \n Do new sources of data require new means of visualization? If so, it isn\u2019t obvious. Consider unstructured social networking data. This information must be structured before it can be visualized, and once it\u2019s structured, we can visualize it in familiar ways. Want to know what people are talking about on Twitter? To answer this question, you search for particular words and phrases that you\u2019ve tied to particular topics and you count their occurrences. Once it\u2019s structured in this way, you can visualize it simply, such as by using a bar graph with a bar for each topic sized by the number of occurrences in ranked order from high to low. If you want to know who\u2019s talking to whom in an email system or what\u2019s linked to what on your Web site, you glean those interactions from your email or Web server and count them. Because these interactions are structured as a network of connections (i.e., not a linear or hierarchical arrangement), you can visualize them as a network diagram: an arrangement of nodes and links. Nodes can be sized to indicate popular people or content and links (i.e., lines that connect the nodes) can vary in thickness to show the volume of interactions between particular pairs of nodes. Never used nodes and links to visualize, explore, and make sense of a network of relationships? This might be new to you, but it\u2019s been around for many years and information visualization researchers have studied the hell out of it. \n What about exponentially increasing data volumes? Does this have an effect on data visualization? Not significantly. In my 30 years of experience using technology to squeeze meaning and usefulness from data, data volumes have always been big. When wasn\u2019t there more data than we could handle? Although it is true that the volume of data continues to grow at an increasing rate, did it cross some threshold in the last few years that has made it qualitatively different from before? I don\u2019t think so. The ability of technology to adequately store and access data has always remained just a little behind what we\u2019d like to have in capacity and performance. A little more and a little faster have always been on our wish list. While information technology has struggled to catch up, mostly by pumping itself up with steroids, it has lost sight of the objective: to better understand the world\u2014at least one\u2019s little part of it (e.g., one\u2019s business)\u2014so we can make it better. Our current fascination with big data has us looking for better steroids to increase our brawn rather than better skills to develop our brains. In the world of analytics, brawn will only get us so far; it is better thinking that will open the door to greater insight. \n Big data is built on the unquestioned premise that more is better. More of the right data can be useful, but more for the sake of more does nothing but complicate our lives. In the words of the 21st\u00a0Century Information Fluency Project, we live in a time of \u201cinfowhelm.\u201d Just because we can generate and collect more and more data doesn\u2019t mean that we should. We certainly shouldn\u2019t until we figure out how to make sense and use of the data we already have. This seems obvious, but almost no attention is being given to building the skills and technologies that help us use data more effectively. As Richards J. Heuer, Jr. argued in the Psychology of Intelligence Analysis (1999), the primary failures of analysis are less due to insufficient data than to flawed thinking. To succeed analytically, we must invest a great deal more of our resources in training people to think effectively and we must equip them with tools that augment cognition. Heuer spent 45 years supporting the work of the CIA. Identifying a potential terrorist plot requires that analysts sift through a lot of data (yes, big data), but more importantly, it relies on their ability to connect the dots. Contrary to Heuer\u2019s emphasis on thinking skills, big data is merely about more, more, more, which will bury most of the organizations that embrace it deeper in shit. \n Is there anything new about data today, big or otherwise, that should be leading us to visualize data differently? I was asked to think about this recently when advising a software vendor that\u2019s trying to develop powerful visualization solutions specifically for managing big data. After wracking my brain, I came up with little. Almost everything that we should be doing to support the visual exploration, analysis, and presentation of data today involves better implementations of visualizations, statistical calculations, and data interactions that we\u2019ve known about for years. Even though these features are old news, they still aren\u2019t readily available in most commercial software today; certainly not in ways that work well. Rather than \u201cgoing to where no one has gone before,\u201d vendors need to do the less glorious work of supporting the basics well and data analysts need to further develop their data sensemaking skills. This effort may not lend itself to an awe-inspiring marketing campaign, but it will produce satisfied customers and revenues will follow. \n I\u2019m sure that new sources of data and increasing volumes might require a few new approaches to data visualization,\u00a0though I suspect that most are minor tweaks rather than significant departures from current approaches. If you can think of any big data problems that visualization should address in new ways, please share them with us. Let\u2019s see if we can identify a few efforts that vendors should support to truly make data more useful. \n Take care,"], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1349", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}, {"content": ["I want to remind those of you who are participating in Perceptual Edge\u2019s 2012 Dashboard Design Competition that the deadline for submissions is fast approaching.

Founded in 1976, SAS (originally an acronym for Statistical Analysis System) became and remains to this day the dominant statistical software vendor. Today, as business intelligence (BI) vendors that know little about statistics are promoting themselves as analytics companies, SAS has taken a wrong turn in its effort to defend its status. This is especially true in regard to statistical graphics. When BI companies show their ignorance of analytics by promoting flashy graphics that look cool but are analytically impoverished, SAS is in a great position to remind the world that statistical graphics are about statistics: meanings derived from quantitative data using proven mathematical methods, which are only valuable to the degree that they are accurate and enlightening. No vendor is in a better position to promote statistical integrity than SAS. So why is SAS taking the low road\u2014one traveled by many BI vendors\u2014to tout its wares? \n SAS is now building products that try to compete with the likes of SAP\u2019s Xcelsius, which obscures data behind 3-D effects of light and shadow. I recently spent a day with the bright and thoughtful folks at SAS who developed the visual exploratory data analysis tool named SAS Visual Analytics, and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t fathom why they would undermine their product with flashy nonsense that threatens the integrity and reputation that SAS has worked so hard to build. My concern grew even greater when I was recently told that SAS has on two occasions featured David McCandless of Information Is Beautiful fame as a keynote speaker at major European events. \n \n Perhaps more than any other proponent of information graphics today, McCandless has lured fledgling practitioners of data visualization to the dark side of sloppy analysis and eye-popping displays that rob information of its clarity, accessibility, accuracy, and meaning. \n Effective data visualization is informed by science: statistics and those fields that strive to understand human perception and cognition. There\u2019s much that we can learn from other disciplines as well, including the graphic arts, but only by focusing clearly on the goal: finding, understanding, and communicating the truth that resides in data about things that matter to preserve and improve them. SAS is undermining its own work by promoting impoverished graphics and those who advocate their use. Have the reins of the company been handed to sales and marketing executives who don\u2019t understand or value statistics? I implore my friends at SAS: \u201cRemember who you are\u2014if not for your own sake, for the sake of your customers.\u201d \n Take care,"], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1338", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}, {"content": ["You might be wondering, \u201cWhat does this usually rational data visualization practitioner mean by the \u2019science of magical thinking\u2019?\u201d The magic that I\u2019m referring to is the age-old practice of magicians\u2014professional conjurers, who use sleight of hand, misdirection, and other methods to astound us. The science that I\u2019m referring to is the work that\u2019s being done, primarily by cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, to learn what we can about the brain (perception and cognition) from the techniques that magicians use to fool us. As it turns out, there is a great deal that magicians can teach us. Most magicians don\u2019t understand what goes on in our brains when they misdirect our attention or manipulate perceptual processes to cause us to see something that isn\u2019t there, but by studying their methods scientifically, we can discern those neurological mechanisms and use them for other purposes. \n So how does this relate to data visualization? When we use visual representations of information to explore and make sense of it, we do so within the limits of our perceptual and cognitive abilities. When done properly, visualizations and the techniques that we use to interact with them can help us work around the limitations that are built into our brains, thereby augmenting our natural abilities through the use of technology. One critical aspect of this human-computer interaction involves the management of attention, which is extremely limited and easily distracted. The lessons that we can learn from magicians will help us build better tools for data sensemaking that complement and extend our abilities. \n I first became aware of the interest of cognitive scientists in the methods of magicians in 2009 when I visited Ron Rensink at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. While there, Ron introduced me to his colleague, Gustav Kuhn, who was visiting from Durham University in the UK. At that time, Kuhn was developing a program at Durham University to study the work of magicians. Since that time I\u2019ve discovered that several other cognitive scientists are also doing similar work. \n The best overall introduction to this area of study that I\u2019ve read so far is Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals About Our Everyday Deceptions , by Drs. Stephen L. Macknick and Susana Martinez-Conde, a husband and wife team of neuroscientists at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. \n  \n Their interest in magic has led them to become amateur magicians themselves and to interact with many of the best magicians in the world today. They coined the term \u201cneuromagic\u201d to describe this specific field of study. In the introduction to their book, Macknick and Martinez-Conde explain how their work led them to the study of magic. \n We knew as vision scientists that artists have made important discoveries about the visual system for hundreds of years, and visual neuroscience has gained a great deal of knowledge about the brain by studying their techniques and ideas about perception. It was painters rather than scientists who first worked out the rules of visual perspective and occlusion, in order to make pigments on a flat canvas seem like a beautiful landscape rich in depth. We realized now that magicians were just a different kind of artist: instead of form and color, they manipulated attention and cognition. \n If you\u2019re interested in learning more about the world of magic and magicians\u2014who are the best, how they train, the extent of their amazing skills, the underworld of grifters and psychics, and how conjurers feel about their secrets being revealed by that masked magician on TV\u2014as well as the lessons that their methods reveal about perception and cognition, I recommend the book Fooling Houdini: Magicians, Mentalists, Math Geeks & the Hidden Powers of the Mind by Alex Stone. As a magician who trained for years to rise through the conjuring ranks, science writer Stone takes us on the fascinating journey of his own experiences from the streets of New York with con men playing Three-card Monte to the inner circle of the Magic Castle, as well as the laboratories of top brain scientists. \n  \n Finally, if you want to peek under the hat, the book Magic in Theory: An Introduction to the Theoretical and Psychological Elements of Conjuring by Peter Lamont and Richard Wiseman, who are both professors of psychology and magicians, does a good job of introducing the methods behind all forms of magic. \n  \n If you\u2019re like me, any excuse to read about magic and learn some of the mechanics of wonder will do. We love to be fooled by skilled magicians. Trust me when I assure you that a peek behind the curtain won\u2019t change that. While enjoying the mystical journey, you\u2019ll develop an understanding of visual perception and cognition (especially attention) that will increase your skills in data visualization. \n Take care,"], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1325", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.amazon.com/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}, {"content": ["This blog entry was written by Bryan Pierce of Perceptual Edge . \n If you\u2019re interested in attending one of Stephen Few\u2019s Visual Business Intelligence Workshops, he\u2019s going to teach five more this year; one in each of the following cities: \n \n Vienna, Austria on September 12 - 14 (If you\u2019d like training soon, this workshop in Vienna is your next opportunity) \n Oslo, Norway on September 19 - 21 \n Portland, Oregon on October 2 - 4 (This workshop is almost completely sold out, but we have a waiting list) \n Sydney, Australia on November 14 - 16 \n Melbourne, Australia on November 19 - 21 \n \n These workshops are a great way to learn the data visualization principles that Stephen teaches in his books. \n -Bryan"], "link": "http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=1320", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.affecto.no/": 1, "http://altis.com.au/": 2, "http://www.marketingqed.com/": 1, "http://www.perceptualedge.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Visual Business Intelligence"}]
