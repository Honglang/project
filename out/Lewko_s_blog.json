In this post I will give a nontechnical description of\u00a0a common\u00a0leakage resilient security model, as well as describe a recent paper in the area with Allison Lewko and Brent Waters , titled \u201cHow to Leak on Key Updates\u201d . \n Review of Public Key Encryption \n Let us (informally) recall the definition of a public key cryptography system. Alice would like to send Bob a private message over an unsecured channel. Alice and Bob have never met before and we assume they do not share any secret information. Ideally, we would like a procedure where 1) Alice and Bob engage in a series of communications resulting in Bob learning the message 2) an eavesdropper, Eve, who intercepts all of the communications sent between Alice and Bob, should not learn any (nontrivial) information about the message . As stated, the problem is information theoretically impossible.\u00a0However, this problem is classically solved under the heading of public key cryptography if we further assume that: \n 1) Eve has limited computational resources, \n2) certain computational problems (such as factoring large integers or computing discrete logarithms in a finite group) are not efficiently solvable, and \n3) we allow Alice and Bob to use randomization (and permit security to fail with very small probability). \n More specifically, a public key protocol works as follows: Bob generates a private and public key, say and respectively. As indicated by the names, is publicly known but Bob retains as secret information. When Alice wishes to send a message to Bob she generates an encrypted ciphertext using the message , Bob\u2019s public key and some randomness. She then sends this ciphertext to Bob via the public channel. When Bob receives the ciphertext he decrypts it using his secret key and recovers .\u00a0While Eve has access to the ciphertext and the secret key ,\u00a0she is unable to learn any nontrivial information about the message (assuming our assumptions are sound). In fact, we require a bit more: even if this is repeated many times (with fixed keys), Eve\u2019s ability to decrypt the ciphertext does not\u00a0meaningfully improve. \n Leakage Resilient Cryptography and our work \n In practice, however, Eve may be able to learn information in addition to what she intercepts over Alice and Bob\u2019s public communications via side channel attacks . Such attacks might include measuring the amount of time or energy Bob uses to carry out computations. The field of leakage resilient cryptography aims to incorporate protection against such attacks into the the security model. In this model, in addition to the ciphertext and public key, we let Eve select a (efficiently computable) function where is the bit length of and is a constant. We now assume, in addition to and , Eve\u00a0 also gets to see . In other words, Eve gains a fair amount of information about the secret key, but not enough to fully determine it. \n Moreover, we allow Eve to specify a different function every time Alice sends Bob a message. There is an obvious problem now, however. If the secret key remained static, then Eve could start by choosing to output the first bits, the second time she could choose to give the next bits, and if she carries on like this, after messages she would have recovered the entire secret key. To compensate for this we allow Bob to update his secret key between messages. The public key will remain the same. \n There has been\u00a0a lot of\u00a0interesting work on this problem.\u00a0In\u00a0the works of Brakerski, Kalai, Katz, and Vaikuntanathan and Dodis, Haralambiev, Lopez-Alt, and Wichs many schemes are presented that are provably secure against continual leakage. In these schemes, however, information about the secret key is permitted to be leaked between updates, but only a tiny amount is allowed to be leaked during the update process itself. \n In\u00a0our current work, we offer the first scheme that\u00a0allows a constant fraction of the information used in the update to be leaked.

In this note we obtain some endpoint restriction estimates for the paraboloid over finite fields. \n Let denote a hypersurface in with surface measure . The restriction problem for is to determine for which pairs of does there exist an inequality of the form \n \n We note that the left-hand side is not necessarily well-defined since we have restricted the function to the hypersurface , a set of measure zero in\u00a0 . However, if we can establish this inequality for all Schwartz functions , then the operator that restricts to (denoted by ), can be defined whenever . In the Euclidean setting, the restriction problem has been extensively studied when is a sphere, paraboloid, and cone. In particular, it has been observed that restriction estimates are intimately connected to questions about certain partial differential equations as well as problems in geometric measure theory such as the Kakeya conjecture. The restriction conjecture states sufficient conditions on for the above inequality to hold. In the case of the sphere and paraboloid, the question is open in dimensions three and higher. \n In 2002 Mockenhaupt and Tao initiated the study of the restriction phenomena in the finite field setting. Let us introduce some notation to formally define the problem in this setting. We let denote a finite field of characteristic . We let denote the unit circle in and define to be a non-principal character of . For example, when , we can set . We will be considering the vector space and its dual space . We can think of as endowed with the counting measure which assigns mass 1 to each point and as endowed with the normalized counting measure which assigns mass to each point (where denotes the size of , so the total mass is equal to 1 here). \n For a complex-valued function on , we define its Fourier transform on by: \n \n For a complex-valued function on , we define its inverse Fourier transform on by: \n \n It is easy to verify that and . \n We define the paraboloid as: . This is endowed with the normalized \u201csurface measure\u201d which assigns mass to each point in . We note that . \nFor a function , we define the function as follows: \n \n For a complex-valued function on and , we define \n \n For a complex-valued function on , we similarly define \n \n Now we define a restriction inequality to be an inequality of the form \n \n where denotes the best constant such that the above inequality holds. By duality, this is equivalent to the following extension estimate: \n \n We will use the notation to denote that quantity is at most a constant times quantity , where this constant may depend on the dimension but not on the field size, . For a finite field , the constant will always be finite. The restriction problem in this setting is to determine for which can we upper bound independently of (i.e. for which does hold). \n Mockenhaupt and Tao\u00a0solved this problem for the paraboloid in two dimensions.\u00a0 In three dimensions, we require not be a square in (without this restriction the parabaloid will contain non-trivial subspaces which\u00a0lead to trivial counterexamples, but we will not elaborate on this here). For such , they showed that and for every . When , their bounds were polylogarithmic in . Mockenhaupt and Tao\u2019s argument for the estimate proceeded by first establishing the estimate for characteristic functions. Here one can expand the norm and reduce the problem to combinatorial estimates. A well-known dyadic pigeonhole argument then allows one to pass back to general functions at the expense of a logarithmic power of . Following a similar approach (but requiring much more delicate Gauss sum estimates), Iosevich and Koh proved that and in higher dimensions (in odd dimensions some additional restrictions on are required). Again, however, this argument incurred a logarithmic loss at the endpoints from the dyadic pigeonhole argument. \n In this note\u00a0we remove the logarithmic losses mentioned above. Our argument begins by rewriting the norm as . We then adapt the arguments of the prior papers to the bilinear variant in the case that and are characteristic functions. \n To obtain estimates for arbitrary functions , we can assume that is non-negative real-valued and decompose as a linear combination of characteristic functions, where the coefficients are negative powers of two (we can do this without loss of generality by adjusting only the constant of our bound). We can then employ the triangle inequality to upper bound by a double sum of terms like , where and are characteristic functions, weighted by negative powers of two. We then apply our bilinear estimate for characteristic functions to these inner terms and use standard bounds on sums to obtain the final estimates. \n Our method yields the following theorems: \n Theorem \u00a0For the paraboloid in dimensions with not a square, we have and . \n Theorem \u00a0For the paraboloid in dimensions when is even or when is odd and for a prime congruent to 3 modulo 4 such that is not a multiple of 4, we have and . \n We recently learned that in unpublished work Bennett, Carbery, Garrigos, and Wright have also obtained the results in the -dimensional case.

Meyers in 1968. It appears that Meyers\u2019 construction doesn\u2019t, however, say anything about the anti-Freiman problem. Indeed Meyers\u2019 set (and all of its subsets) contains a set of density . Hence, the construction of a set that doesn\u2019t contain a large set still appears to be new. A revised version of the paper has been posted reflecting this information.\u00a0 Most notably, we have changed the title to \u201cOn the Structure of Sets of Large Doubling\u201d. \n Allison Lewko and I recently\u00a0arXiv\u2019ed our paper \u201c Sets of Large Doubling and a Question of Rudin \u201c. The paper (1) answers a question of Rudin regarding the structure of sets (2) negatively answers a question of O\u2019Bryant about the existence of a certain \u201canti-Freiman\u201d theorem (3) establishes a variant of the (solved) Erd\u00f6s-Newman conjecture . I\u2019ll briefly describe each of these results below. \n \u2014 Structure of sets \u2014 \n Before describing the problem we will need some notation. Let and define to be the number of unordered solutions to the equation with . We say that is a set if for all . There is a similar concept with sums replaced by differences. Since this concept is harder to describe we will only introduce it in the case . For we define to be the number of solutions to the equation with . If for all nonzero we say that is a set. \n Let be a subset of the integers , and call an -polynomial if it is a trigonometric polynomial whose Fourier coefficients are supported on (i.e. if ). We say that is a set (for ) if \n \n holds for all -polynomials where the constant only depends on and . If is an even integer, we can expand out the norm in 1. This quickly leads to the following observation: If is a set then is also an set ( , ). One can also easily show using the triangle inequality that the union of two sets is also a set. It follows that the finite union of sets is a set. In 1960 Rudin asked the following natural question: Is every set is a finite union of sets? \n In this paper we show that the answer is no in the case of sets. In fact, we show a bit more than this. One can easily show that a set is also a set. Our first counterexample to Rudin\u2019s question proceeded (essentially) by constructing a set which wasn\u2019t the finite union of sets. This however raised the following variant of Rudin\u2019s question: Is every set the mixed finite union of and sets? We show that the answer to this question is no as well. To do this we construct a set, A, which isn\u2019t a finite union of sets, and a set, , which isn\u2019t the finite union of sets. We then consider the product set which one can prove is a subset of . It isn\u2019t hard to deduce from this that is a subset of that isn\u2019t a mixed finite union of and sets. Moreover, one can (essentially) map this example back to while preserving all of the properties stated above. Generalizing this further, we show that there exists a set that doesn\u2019t contain (in a sense that can be made precise) a large or . This should be compared with a related theorem of Pisier which states that every Sidon set contains a large independent set (it is conjectured that a Sidon set is a finite union of independent sets, however this is open). \n We have been unable to extend these results to sets for . Very generally, part of the issue arises from the fact that the current constructions hinges on the existence of arbitrary large binary codes which can correct\u00a0strictly more than a fraction of errors. To modify this construction (at least in a direct manner) to address the problem for, say, sets it appears one would need arbitrary large binary codes that can correct strictly more than\u00a0a fraction of errors. However, one can show that such objects do not exist. \n \u2014\u00a0Is there an anti-Freiman theorem? \u2014 \n \u00a0Let be a finite set of integers and denote the sumset of as . A trivial inequality is the following \n \n In fact, it isn\u2019t hard to show that equality only occurs on the left if is an arithmetic progression and only occurs on the right if is a set. A celebrated theorem of Freiman states that if then is approximately an arithmetic progression. More precisely, if is a finite set satisfying for some constant , then is contained in a generalized arithmetic progression of dimension and size where and depend only on and not on . \n It is natural to ask about the opposite extreme: if , what can one say about the structure of as a function only of ? A first attempt might be to guess that if for some positive constant , then can be decomposed into a union of  sets where and depend only on . This is easily shown to be false. For example, one can start with a of elements contained in the interval and take its union with the arithmetic progression . It is easy to see that regardless of . However, the interval cannot be decomposed as the union of  sets with and independent of . \n There are two ways one might try to fix this problem: first, we might ask only that contains a set of size , where and depend only on . (This formulation\u00a0was posed as an open problem by O\u2019Bryant here ). Second, we might ask that hold for all subsets for the same value of . Either of these changes would rule out the trivial counterexample given above. In this paper we show that even applying both of these modifications simultaneously is not enough to make the statement true. We provide a sequence of sets where holds for all of their subsets for the same value of , but if we try to locate a set, , of density in then must tend to infinity with the size of . As above, our initial construction of such a sequence of \u2018s turned out to be sets. This leads us to the even weaker anti-Freiman conjecture: \n (Weak Anti-Freiman) Suppose that satisfies and for all subsets . Then contains either a set or a set of size , where and depend only on . \n We conclude by showing that even this weaker conjecture fails. The constructions are the same as those used in the results above. The two problems are connected by the elementary observation that if is a subset of a set then holds where only depends on the constant of the set . \n \u2014 A variant of the Erd\u00f6s-Newman conjecture \u2014 \n In the early 1980\u2032s\u00a0Erd\u00f6s and Newman independently made the following conjecture: For every there exists a that isn\u2019t a finite union of sets for any . This conjecture was later confirmed by\u00a0Erd\u00f6s for certain values of using Ramsey theory, and finally resolved completely by\u00a0Ne\u0161et\u0159il and\u00a0R\u00f6dl using Ramsey graphs. One further application of our technique is the following theorem which can be viewed as an analog of the Erd\u00f6s-Newman problem with the roles of the union size and reversed. \n Theorem 1 For every there exists a\u00a0union of  sets that isn\u2019t a finite union of  sets for any ."], "link": "http://lewko.wordpress.com/2010/04/02/sets-of-large-doubling-and-a-question-of-rudin/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.ams.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://userweb.utexas.edu/": 1, "http://arxiv.org/": 3, "http://www.indiana.edu/": 1, "http://www.math-inst.hu/": 1, "http://archive.numdam.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Lewko's blog"}, {"content": ["A key component in the work of Green, Tao , and Ziegler on arithmetic and polynomial progressions in the primes is the dense model theorem.

Since it was raining and the nearby\u00a0streets were busy, I fed the dog and then brought it to Austin\u2019s Town Lake animal shelter . The next day I called the shelter to learn that if the dog wasn\u2019t adopted within three days it would likely be euthanized. With the help of several other members of the UT mathematical community, dozens of emails, phone calls, and Internet postings were made in an effort to find the pup a home. (In fact, the mathematical blogsphere was represented in these efforts.) \n We named the dog (who was found without tags or a microchip) after former UT mathematician George Halstead (who also had some trouble making a home in Austin). Our efforts were first met by several failed applications. While these were disappointing, they did buy Halstead an extended stay at Town Lake. \n I just got off the phone with Town Lake and I am happy to report that Halstead has been adopted! She will leave for her forever home tomorrow.

While this is a difficult open problem, progress has been made from a number of different directions. Perhaps most notably, Chen has shown that every sufficiently large even positive integer is the sum of a prime and an almost prime (that is an integer that is a product of at most two primes). In another direction, Montgomery and Vaughan have shown that if is the set of positive even integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes then \n \u00a0 \n for some positive constant . This is stronger than the observation (which was made much earlier) that almost every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of two primes. In this post we\u2019ll be interested in sets of integers with the property that most integers can be expressed as the sum of two elements from the set. To be more precise we\u2019ll say that a set of positive integers has the Goldbach property (GP) if the sumset consists of a positive proportion of the integers. From the preceding discussion we have that the set of primes has the GP. (This discussion is closely related to the theory of thin bases.) \n A natural first question in investigating such sets would be to ask how thin such a set can be. Simply considering the number of possible distinct sums, the reader can easily verify that a set (of positive integers) with the GP must satisfy \n \u00a0 \n This is to say that a set of positive integers with the GP must satisfy for all large . Recall that the prime number theorem gives us that \u00a0for the set of primes\u00a0 . Thus the primes are much thicker than a set with the GP needs to be (at least from naive combinatorial considerations). \n Considering this, one might ask if there is a subset of the primes with the GP but having significantly lower density in the integers. I recently (re)discovered that the answer to this question is yes. In particular we have that \n \u00a0 Theorem 1 \u00a0There exists a subset of the primes such that has positive density in the integers and \n \n \n \u00a0This last inequality shows that is as thin as such a set can be. In fact, one can show that a generic subset of the primes of this density will work. This result, in an more quantitative form, has been observed by Granville and earlier by Wirsing . Here I\u2019ll present the somewhat different argument I found which is based on a theorem of Bourgain . \n \u00a0Some properties of sets \n In this section we define sets and record some of their properties. Let . For we say that is a set (with constant ) if for every function such that (here denotes the -th Fourier coefficient of ) we have \n \n There is a rich theory to sets (being an instance of the Restriction phenomenon in Fourier analysis), however we will only need a few key properties. The following theorem was proved in this paper of Rudin (which is also where sets were first defined). \n Theorem 2 \u00a0 If is a set for , and is an arithmetic progression then .\u00a0 More specifically, we have that \n \n This tells us, for example, that a set must satisfy for large . These sets also have a number of nice combinatorial properties. Here we record a basic lemma (which can be found as Lemma 4.30 in Tao and Vu\u2019s Additive Combinatorics ) which is easily deduced from Parseval\u2019s identity. \n Lemma 3 \u00a0 Let be a set with constant and let be a finite subset of . We then have \n \n \u00a0We now state a theorem of Bourgain. \n \u00a0 Theorem 4 \u00a0For any there exists a set, consisting of only of primes such that \n \n \u00a0The proof of this theorem is fairly involved and relies on number theoretic as well as probabilistic arguments. We will only need this result in the case when . In this case (since is an even integer and norms can be expanded) both parts of the argument can be significantly simplified. In particular the only number theoretic information that is required are upper bounds on the number of ways an integer can be represented as the sum of two primes (see, for example,\u00a0this paper of Green and Tao ). Information of this sort can be readily obtained by standard sieve methods. \n Let us now fit these pieces together to prove the theorem. \n Proof of Theorem 1 \n Let be the set given by Bourgain\u2019s theorem. By virtue of the fact that is a set we have that\u00a0 \n \n On the other hand, for sufficiently large we also have that . Applying Lemma\u00a0 3 , we have that . We can conclude that\u00a0 \n \n and the theorem follows. \n Some Remarks \n The argument here (via the proof of Bourgain\u2019s theorem) constructs the set in a probabilistic manner. This is also the case in the arguments of Granville and Wirsing. In fact all of these arguments proceed by showing that a generic (in an appropriate sense) has the property that one is seeking. It would be very interesting to construct an explicit example of such a set. \n As we remarked earlier we are only using Bourgain\u2019s theorem when is an even integer, in which case his argument can be simplified considerably. It would be interesting to find an analogous combinatorial interpretation of sets for . Presumably this would lead to a deeper result about the primes. \n The proof of Bourgain\u2019s theorem uses very little about the primes. Similar ideas can be applied to other number theoretic sets, such as polynomial sequences. In fact, his paper gives a general criterion for a set to containing a subsets of maximal density."], "link": "http://lewko.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/thin-sets-of-primes-and-the-goldbach-property/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://lewko.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.ams.org/": 8, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Lewko's blog"}]
