[{"blogurl": "http://dataremixed.com\n", "blogroll": [], "title": "DataRemixed"}, {"content": ["Any time you find yourself with a data set with more than a few columns, say for example the 2012 Major League Baseball regular season stats sheet, you have a number of options when it comes to data exploration and discovery. The data set has all \u201cqualifying\u201d players, their team & position, and their number of games played, at bats, hits, homeruns, doubles, RBIs, etc. for the 2012 regular season. You can find the table online here . \n Option #1: Table Madness \nYou could just sort and filter the table, and maybe even color-code the cells with some fancy conditional formatting in Excel (Home > Conditional Formatting > Color Scales > Red \u2013 White \u2013 Blue Color Scale). Interesting approach, but this doesn\u2019t make use of the human brain\u2019s superior capacity to make use of position or size to compare values. I\u2019ll save it for all those dense quarterly financial spreadsheets. Here it is, for posterity: \n  \n Option #2: \u201cO-F-A-T\u201d \nOne option (called \u201cO-F-A-T\u201d, or \u201cOne Factor at a Time\u201d) is to view each parameter, say, Homeruns, all by itself in a basic chart like a histogram. Rinse & repeat for all the other parameters. As nice as that is, you won\u2019t really know anything about potential correlations between variables, you\u2019ll just know each variable in isolation: \n  \n Option #3: Small Multiples \nYou could make a whole panel of histograms of each parameter, which would really just be a more efficient way of Option #2. Or, as demonstrated in Chapter 6 of Visualize This , you could plot each variable against each other variable in a scatterplot matrix (one form of small multiples chart). This option is preferred by many (created here using the R function \u201cpairs()\u201d which includes fitted LOESS curves ), as it allows you to quickly scan for strong correlations between two variables (in this case, I reduced the number of variables in the matrix from 16 to 10 for readability): \n  \n A fairly quick scan shows that Homeruns and RBIs are fairly closely correlated in a positive sense (as are At bats and Runs). Can you spot the negative correlations? Not that hard to notice that Homeruns and Stolen Bases seem to be negatively correlated, right? To a fan of the game of baseball, none of these correlations will be particularly surprising, but the power in this approach is that many, many correlations can be identified, at least roughly speaking, in a very short amount of time. Do a quick Google Image search for \u201c small multiples \u201d and you\u2019ll find other great examples of this powerful visualization. Here\u2019s a recent piece by the New York Times showing drought conditions in the US since the late 19th century. Bottom line: I love small multiples. \n Option #4: Interactive Visualizations \n Lastly, you could create an interactive data discovery dashboard (created here using Tableau Public ), using Parameters to allow the explorer of the data set to dynamically assign any of the 16 variables to the x-axis, the y-axis, the color palette or the circle size: \n \n  \n \n Powered by Tableau \n \n This effectively allows the user to compare any of the 4 parameters together. Of course, since position is more easy to discern than either color or area, the true comparison is still between the variable on the x-axis and the variable on the y-axis. Still, the other two variables are \u201calong for the ride\u201d, aiding a secondary analysis. The interactive environment also allows for the user to hover the mouse over any data point and learn more about the datum, or filter the view (in this case by either position or team). \n So, Which Do You Prefer? \n What I\u2019d really like to know is: between Option #3 (small multiples) and Option #4 (interactive visualizations), which do you prefer, if any, and why? Do you prefer seeing it all at once at a high level, or do you want the ability to drill down, filter and customize a more limited but intricate view? Or are these totally different tools for totally different purposes that shouldn\u2019t really be contrasted? \n Thanks for stopping by! \nBen"], "link": "http://dataremixed.com/2012/10/interactive-visualizations-or-small-multiples/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://complexdiagrams.com/": 1, "http://www.tableausoftware.com/": 2, "https://www.google.com/": 1, "http://mlb.mlb.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 1, "http://dataremixed.com/": 4}, "blogtitle": "DataRemixed"}, {"content": ["It was hard not to watch the coverage of Felix Baumgartner\u2019s record breaking plunge yesterday.

I\u2019ve tried to, so thanks Enrico. \n Relate \u00a0(it\u2019s all about the people, anyway) \u2013 I started by creating a twitter account and finding other data viz nut cases to follow, and then I read what they posted, and tried to publish respectful and insightful comments on their blogs. Whether they always saw my comments as respectful and insightful, I\u2019m not sure, but I let their blog posts be triggers to my own posts, and made sure to mention them as my source of inspiration. I emailed them and asked for their opinion of something I had created\u00a0 before pushing the big red \u201cpublish\u201d button. Then, I started reaching out to them via email and asking them to let me record a Skype conversation with them, and publish it as a podcast. Why not? \u00a0I feel like I have made great connections that way. \n Educate (a blog should provide others real value) \u2013 I noticed that the posts of other blogs that I liked the most were always helpful. They didn\u2019t just give \u201cTop 5 ways to\u2026\u201d link-bait mumbo jumbo, they were more like guided tutorials . I experimented with how-to videos and screen shot walk-throughs , and I felt like I actually made a small contribution that way.

Lots of people say that to sound smart, but not me. A 6 year old and an 8 year old have both played me to stalemate, and not because I let them. Of course, the saving grace is that they are my sons, so my abject shame is replaced with a dad\u2019s pride. Losing to your kids is kind of like winning. \n In spite of this fortunate side effect, I put together this winning chess openings dataviz with Tableau to make sure neither budding wiz kid\u2019s king slipped through my fingers again. At least not any time soon. It uses data from this website , which I was not able to substantiate with a second source, so take it with a grain of salt (thanks, internets). \n \n  \n \n Powered by Tableau \n \n How was it made? \n1. The time-consuming part was converting each of the 20 openings in the viz from standard chess notation in the website to a spreadsheet structured as follows (each row corresponds to a specific piece on the board, e.g. wp1 = white\u2019s first pawn, on square A2 to start the game): \n  \n 2. Once all of this was converted to an Excel spreadsheet, the win/draw/loss stats were added to each row, and the Tableau reshaping tool was used to convert the spreadsheet to prepare for connection with Tableau. \n 3. A chess board image and chess piece images were found using Google Image search. \n 4. I started with the chess board view, which looks as follows: \n  \n 4a. I added the \u201cx-pos\u201d field to the column shelf and the \u201cy-pos\u201d field to the row shelf and converted each from a SUM to a dimension (32 small circle shapes appeared in the general positions of the pieces). \n 4b. I added the chess board background image by selecting Map > Background Images > Add Image, browsing to the chess board image file location, setting the coordinates to -0.35 and 9.35 for both the x-axis and the y-axis, and selecting \u201cAlways Show Entire Image\u201d in the Options tab. Voil\u00e0. \n 4c. I dragged the \u201cPiece\u201d field to the Shape shelf, clicked the down arrow in the \u201cPiece\u201d legend that appeared in the bottom left and selected \u201cEdit Shape\u2026\u201d. I had saved the chess piece images in .png format to the \u201cMy Tableau Repository\u201d and \u201cShapes\u201d folders in a new folder I created called \u201cChess\u201d. Then it was a matter of choosing the \u201cChess\u201d option from the \u201cSelect Shape Pallette:\u201d drop down menu and assigning the right image to the right piece code (wk = white king, bk=black king, etc.). \n 4d. The Quick Filters were added to limit the board view to one and only one opening (instead of showing all of them overlaid on one another, which just jumbles all the openings into one view). \n 5. A stacked bar chart was created for the chess opening outcomes as shown below: \n  \n 5a. This is basically just a stacked bar chart with some fancy formatting, but the starting point is a bar chart with the \u201cOpening\u201d field in the Rows shelf and the \u201cFrequency\u201d field in the Columns shelf, with the \u201cOutcome\u201d field in the Color shelf. Also added are the rank and the Pts/100 Games fields. The only trick was the sorting \u2013 I wanted to sort based on the Points per 100 Games, but had to do so manually. I\u2019m pretty sure there was a better way to do that, but ran out of time. \n 6. After that, I just made a simple table for the move notation and a \u201cHover for Instructions\u201d image, and dropped everything into a Dashboard. \n In case you want to try it out, here is the Excel spreadsheet , and you can download the completed Tableau Public workbook by clicking \u201cDownload\u201d in the bottom right corner of the workbook above.

I\u2019ve found that many data discovery efforts include Excel at some point or another in the process. \n If you are interested in getting better at Excel, I highly recommend you follow Jon Peltier , Jorge Camoes and Chandoo . These three guys are the Excel pros, and much of what I have learned over the past few years has come from them. I haven\u2019t featured any Excel dashboards on this blog thus far, but thanks to a recent contest at Chandoo.org, I found myself cranking out the old pivot tables and vlookup formulas to see what I could do with a provided data set of 1,883 responses to a recent salary survey. \n So how did it go? \n Well I have to admit, after a solid year of using mostly Tableau to explore data sets, staying in Excel felt a little like speaking a foreign language. Many times I found myself struggling to do something that would have been second nature in Tableau. I think a huge part of that is the difference in the tools themselves (Tableau is designed specifically for data discovery via visualization), but certainly part of it had to be the user as well \u2013 I just haven\u2019t been spending that much time in Excel doing this type of activity lately. \n And what was the end result? \n Here is my final submission. You can download the Excel file here \u00a0(692KB): \n  \n \n This survey exploration worksheet shows: \n \n Summary statistics across the top \n Top 5 and bottom 5 country lists, and \n A two-country comparison tool in the middle \n Column charts showing mean salary along with +/- 1 standard deviation error bars at the bottom with \n Pivot table \u201cslicers\u201d which function as global filters for everything in the worksheet \n \n The last bullet point \u2013 \u201cslicers\u201d is the most powerful part of the worksheet, and only available (I believe) in Excel 2010. Slicers are cool because they allow the user of the worksheet to drill down to any combination of response attributes. They\u2019re basically like \u201cQuick Filters\u201d in Tableau. An added bell (or whistle if you prefer) is that the country tables include a flag to the left of the country name that changes to match the corresponding country when the slicer filters are applied. \u201cOoo, fancy!\u201d Hey, thanks! \n To try it out for yourself, just download the worksheet, open it with Excel 2010, and click on any of the colored pills in the section to the lower right under the \u201cGlobal Filters\u201d header (you can hold down Ctrl to select multiple attributes and press Alt + C or click the little icon in the upper right of the pill grouping to clear the filter). \n What did I learn? \n You have to be careful because many of the countries only have a single survey respondent, making average \u201cmean\u201dingless (sorry). This often happens with survey response data \u2013 people make all kinds of conclusions based on very small sample sizes. While I went ahead and ranked the countries based on mean anyhow, I included the all-important \u201cn\u201d column in the table to flag the user. I stopped short of doing any tests for statistical significance, but this could have been done as well. I also added the \u201cregion\u201d field, which wasn\u2019t included in the original data set at all. I was able to obtain these region categories from the UN stats website . It sounds easy enough, but believe me, it was a pain (\u2018Vietnam\u2019 vs. \u2018Viet Nam\u2019 is one example of many mismatches that had to be manually adjusted). \n How to build it: \n \n Summary statistics \u2013 these cells are pointed to the grand total row of a simple pivot table . Nothing fancy here. I added it because it really highlights the \u201cbig picture\u201d for the user, before they get into the details below. \n Top & Bottom 5 lists \u2013 same thing for the tables themselves, the cells are pointed to two different pivot tables, the first of which is sorted based on descending average salary (so the best are at the top), and the second of which is sorted based on ascending average salary (so the worst are at the top). \n Two-country comparison \u2013 this section makes use of two data validation cells that allow the user to pick two countries from a drop-down list in a separate worksheet tab. The list is generated from the country name column of yet another pivot table. \n Updating flags \u2013 This was the trickiest part to do. Its hard to explain, so I will refer you to this post or this video . Basically, you create a second table in a different worksheet with the country names and the respective flag images fitted to the adjacent cells, name the cells (Ctrl+Shift+F3), create special formulas (Ctrl+F3) using the =INDIRECT() function, and map each image in the worksheet to the right formula. \n The four column charts in the lower section each have their own pivot table (there must be a more efficient way to do this \u2013 suggestions are welcome!) and the error bars are added using the \u2018Layout > Error Bars > More Error Bars Options\u2019 path and selecting the custom error bars option and pointing it to a pivot table with standard deviations for each of the four attributes (region, experience, job and usage). More on error bars at Jon\u2019s site here . \n Slicers: a great tutorial that Chandoo created to teach about slicers can be found here . This part really wasn\u2019t that difficult, you just have to know to include slicers using the \u2018Analyze > Include Slicer\u2019 menu path, and to connect each slicer to all of the pivot tables in the document so that they act as global filters. \n \n Now it\u2019s your turn \n What\u2019s your take?

That and you\u2019ll get to hear his Yorkshire accent, which is reason enough to listen. \n Here are some key excerpts: \n About the training sessions \u2013 what is covered, and what is the format? \n Andy \u2013 \u201cWe cover in the first instance, the background of the subject, the foundation of some of the key theories, especially around cognitive science about how the brain and the eyes work \u2013 visual perception, and then we really launch into the methodology and the morning session is really around the preparatory stage, about how you contextualize and understand exactly what you\u2019re trying to achieve with the visualization project, what curiosities you\u2019re answering, what questions, what story you\u2019re trying to portray, and also the intimate familiarization process of getting the raw data and learning about this raw material that you\u2019re going to be working with. \n \u201cAnd then we move on in the afternoon session purely about the design \u2013 What are the different visual options, the different visual layers that we need to harmonize and bring to a creative solution, but also the reasoning why some solutions work better than others\u2026 \n \u201cAnd then we finish off with the construction and the launch of a project\u2026we spend a decent amount of time in groups, conceiving a potential solution to a given problem, and using that session help try and cement what we\u2019ve learned for the rest of the day.\u201d \n On Andy\u2019s philosophy or approach to data visualization: \n \u201cI try and steer clear of any strict rules and hard principles.\u00a0I tend to present considerations \u2013 things that people need to think about and justify to themselves or their client because there are so many different scenarios that lead to endless permutations about when something is a better solution than others, so I try and equip people with the thinking skills to be able to reason themselves through a project.\u201d \n On the type of people that attend: \n \u201cThe variety and the richness of the background of people going to these events is fantastic for me. It\u2019s not a single industry, it\u2019s not a single, typical delegate. It\u2019s literally everyone from every background \u2013 all ages, all levels of seniority\u2026And for me that\u2019s kind of justified the very objective, or the very mission I was trying to fulfill, which is to take this subject to all these people around the world, who are really representing the age that we live in \u2013 everyone is responsible for data in some shape, way or form, whether it\u2019s analyzing or presenting or any kind of stage of the process. Everyone\u2019s now got a responsibility that would otherwise in the past have been on the fringes of an organization, or very specialist roles, statisticians, engineers. And so the sheer fact is that the variety of people that come along to these events just sort of supports that mission, really.\u201d \n More training sessions coming soon! \n The good news for folks like me on the west cost of North America is that Andy plans on bringing his training sessions to our neighborhood in the winter. Who wouldn\u2019t want to visit L.A. and San Diego at that time of year? I\u2019ll be sure to post a link to the 2nd leg of his tour as soon as it is announced. In the meantime, if you want to influence what cities are included in the itinerary, now is the time to let Andy know. You can get Andy\u2019s contact info here . \n Thanks for stopping by, and many, many thanks to you, Andy, for sharing your insights with me and my readers! \n Ben"], "link": "http://dataremixed.com/2012/06/interview-with-andy-kirk/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.visualisingdata.com/": 3, "https://twitter.com/": 1, "http://visualisingdata.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "DataRemixed"}]
