If you want to embed the \u201clatest snapshot\u201d of a dashboard, i.e., an image that updates automatically, then continue reading. The URL to your dashboard will have a link similar to this: http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/ArsenalPerformance/TheDominanceofRVP All you have to do to get an image of the dashboard is to add \u201c.png\u201d to the end of the URL. My URL now looks like: http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/ArsenalPerformance/TheDominanceofRVP.png and here\u2019s the resulting image.  This is a nice static snapshot, but your user, let\u2019s see she\u2019s a saleswoman, wants this in PowerPoint (she doesn\u2019t want to have to go to Tableau Server) and she wants PowerPoint to always reflect the latest data. An example might be a sales report that you published on Tableau Server that refreshes weekly on Sunday night. The saleswoman wants to open PowerPoint every Monday and have it reflect the latest data. Here\u2019s how you do it (Windows only): Step 1 \u2013 From the PowerPoint ribbon, choose Insert \u2013> Image.  Step 2 \u2013 Paste the link to the image in the File name box and click the triangle next to the Open button.  Step 3 \u2013 The Open button might gray out for a few seconds while the image is retrieved and you may be prompted to login to Tableau Server. Go ahead and do so.  Step 4 \u2013 Choose Insert and Link when the menu appears.  That\u2019s it! You now have an embedded, dynamically updating image from your Tableau Server inside PowerPoint. Of course, you now need to save the PowerPoint file. When your saleswoman opens the PowerPoint file, she\u2019ll be prompted with a security warning. She needs to choose Enable Content.  Another security warning may appear, and she should choose Yes at this message. She should NOT check the \u201cDo not ask me\u2026\u201d message because that setting extends beyond this specific file.  The image now reflects the latest data on Tableau Server. Try it yourself by opening the PPT file used for this blog post here . Reminder : This works for Windows only. PowerPoint on Mac does not have the same embed functionality (that I could find). Also, when you open the PPT file on a Mac, your are not given the prompt to Enable External Images and the image will not update dynamically. If anyone knows how to do this in PowerPoint on a Mac, please let me know.

Line chart - A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time \u2013 a time series \u2013 thus the line is often drawn chronologically. * Source: Wikipedia  After reading these, one might suggest that an area chart provides the best of both worlds. Consider this area chart:  First impressions are often something like: \u201cThis is perfect! It shows me both the trends and the contribution.\u201d However, it doesn\u2019t show the trends as well as one might suspect. Why?  Our eyes tend to focus on the tops of each line, leading to misinterpreting the patterns. It\u2019s nearly impossible for us to translate the width of each color (i.e., the actual value) into an accurate trend. This is because the pattern of each color is influenced by the colors below it. The only values that can be effectively interpreted are the West (gray area) and the total (top of the blue line). Try this exercise. Looking at the East and without scrolling down in this blog post, take one minute (using a timer) and try to draw the trend for the East only. In other words, if the chart was only the East, what would the pattern look like? Give it a shot, it\u2019ll prove a point. Here\u2019s what the East looks like:  If you were able to draw this accurately in under a minute, then you\u2019re likely some incredible genius, and good for you. In every data visualization class I teach I use this exercise. I have yet to see anyone get close. So that brings us to another question. What\u2019s the best way to display the pattern for each region AND show the total. I recommend this:  Now you get the best of both worlds:  You can see the trends for each region. You can see the total. I accomplished this in Tableau with one table calc - TOTAL(SUM([Sales])) \u2013 and created a dual-axis chart by placing Total Sales on the secondary axis and synchronizing them. Download the Tableau workbook here . I can\u2019t recommend enough the exercise I outlined above. Sometimes asking the person you\u2019re working with to draw the second area will prove your point for you. Hopefully this will give you some ammunition next time you need to argue against stacked area charts.   P.S. If you\u2019re curious to see the two charts together, here you go.

He was building a tag analysis dashboard and was using a parameter that listed all of the tags, but then had an \u201cAll\u201d option at the top. I completely changed the discussion and asked how he did it, and it\u2019s so simple. Step 1: Add the field you want to filter to the Rows shelf.

The advantage of right-clicking on the field you want to build the parameter on is that the list of values is pre-populated. Add (All) to the list of values.

Step 3: Right-click on the parameter and choose \u201cShow Parameter Control\u201d. It should pop up on the right side of the view.

Step 5: Drag the Sub-Category filter to the Filters shelf and select the True option.   That\u2019s it! To see it in action, pick something from your parameter, then change it back to (All).

I don\u2019t think a day has gone by when I haven\u2019t learned something. I love the Tableau community because everyone freely shares ideas from which they hope others borrow. This technique of from-to patterns is no exception; it\u2019s definitely not a new topic I\u2019m covering here. But I do like documenting the processes I follow, which is more or less why I started this blog in the first place. Paths are not a feature I use often, so in my inevitable quest for all things Tableau, I decided to find some data that would provide a good learning experience. The data for this post comes from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics . Here\u2019s a sample of the data.   Each origin airport/destination airport combination is represented as one row in the spreadsheet. This is great, but in order to use Tableau\u2019s Path functionality, you need to have two records for each origin/destination combination. The first for the starting point, and the second for the ending point.  You can accomplish this quite easily through Custom SQL. The example below contains all the columns I need from the spreadsheet.  Those before the red box are inherent in the spreadsheet. The SQL inside the red box is for the fields I have to add to make the paths work.  You must specify the path. In this case, 1 is the starting point, 2 the ending point. I added additional latitude and longitude fields to capture the starting and ending points. That is, I use the origin lat/long when my path = 1 and the destination lat/long when my path = 2. I included a concatenated string for the route, which I will use on the Level of Detail shelf. Union the SQL for path 1 to itself, but change the path to 2 and change the lat/long to the destination lat/long. Notice that the Route calculation stays to same.   In Tableau, all you have to do is:  Double-click on both Latitude and Longitude to draw the map Add Route to the Level of Detail shelf Change the Mark Type to line Add the Path Order dimension to the Path shelf   You now have a giant mess of lines all over the place that represent every single route in the data. That\u2019s all you need to do.  The trick is that you need to write the custom SQL in order to have your data in a usable format. I wanted to take the viz a bit farther though, so I created this interactive version on Tableau Public.    Powered by Tableau  I included:  Filters options for Origin Airport, Destination Airport, and Airline (I chose ATL as my initial view since it\u2019s the world\u2019s busiest airport) Colors to indicate the length of the route Clicking on a color highlights the routes in the selected flight range and also highlights the destination airports on the bottom map A map of the number of passengers that flew to each destination, indicated by the size of the bubble Custom tooltips, which include the great-circle distance calculation This is a pretty fun viz to interact with. Choose all origin airports and you see all of the routes. Choose the airport you most frequently fly from. Choose your preferred airline. The three New York airports are particularly interesting (EWR, LGA, JFK). There are lots of other data elements that could be included, but I haven\u2019t gotten to. Think about adding options to color the bubbles and lines by things like frequency of delays, average ticket price, etc. Wouldn\u2019t this be really cool to do with your friend networks on Facebook ?

Sports Chart of the Day has interesting content, but creates horrible charts; we all know that too. This time, Sports Chart of the day is trying to represent deviations with pie charts. Really, seriously, I\u2019m not lying. Here\u2019s the evidence.   If the headline of Cork Gaines \u2019 article didn\u2019t tell you what the point of the story was, do you think you\u2019d actually be able to deduce anything from his pie charts? Can you tell me who is the largest % underpaid?  This has to be in the top 2 or 3 worst ways to represent change. But then again, Sports Chart of the Day (and their cohorts over at Chart of the Day) create quite a bit of chart junk. There\u2019s some pretty basic information available and there are also some simple ways to portray the data that will tell the story better. Let\u2019s go through a few examples (in no particular order). Example 1: Bar in bar chart, labeled by the amount under/overpaid  With this chart design, you can compare the salaries at a glance, both for the player and across the team. Example 2: Bar in bar chart, but the bar lengths represent the % of the team payroll for each player.  This chart is the identical shape as example 1, but the percentages provide a bit more perspective than the raw numbers. You cannot easily discern from example 1 that LeBron should account for 30% of the team payroll. In both example 1 and example 2, you\u2019re able to quickly rank the players based on their current salary (you may not have even noticed that they\u2019re not in order on the pie charts). So I can clearly see that Mike Miller is the 5th highest paid player and that he\u2019s basically making 2x what he deserves. It\u2019d be even better if you could select your sort criteria. Fortunately I can build and share in seconds using Tableau. Click here to see it live. Example 3 : Bar chart that shows the amount each player is underpaid or overpaid. Color is used as an additional visual cue.  This chart represents the math between the two bars in chart 1 so that the focus is directly on the amount LeBron is underpaid (and the amount Chris Bosh is overpaid). I prefer this over example 1 because the message is much simpler and clearer. Example 4: Bar chart that represents that % that a player is underpaid or overpaid. In other words, who is really getting screwed.  Interesting\u2026when you compare this chart to example 3, it\u2019s a very different story. Yes, LeBron is the most underpaid, but that\u2019s because he makes so much money. This chart here tells us that he\u2019s actually getting screwed the LEAST of those that are underpaid. Can you imagine being underpaid by 44% and being able to prove it? James Jones\u2019 agent needs to get to work! This chart also shows us how ludicrously overpaid Wade, Bosh and Miller are. Good luck restructuring those contracts to help out their teammates. I\u2019ve provided four alternatives, but many more exist.

When emphasizing rank, never sort your categories alphabetically. Next question, which sector was the 4th fastest grower? I bet it\u2019ll take you longer than it should to find out. A few very small tweaks, that take all of 10 seconds, would have made their chart so much more effective.  Sort the sectors descending by growth rate, i.e., winners at the top, losers at the bottom Color code the bars to complement the length of the bars, i.e., double emphasize the point Put the mark labels on the ends of the bars Update the title \u2013 They didn\u2019t mention that distribution channels were the leaders. Why not? I don\u2019t get it.    Which sector was the 6th fastest grower? I bet it took you less than 2 seconds, certainly far less time than when the sectors are sorted alphabetically. Now their story makes more sense. If only they would give their work a bit of thought and put more pride into it. Nielsen consistently looks like they\u2019re slapping a bunch of stuff together so that they can publish quickly.

First, let me say that this is a tremendous improvement over those produced by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (a.k.a. the ATF). Don\u2019t bother reading the ATF report, unless you love 3D bar charts and 3D pie charts created in Excel. A stacked bar chart is basically a pie chart unrolled to make a stick. And more often than not, when plotted as a time series, they do a poor job at showing the overall trends. Stacked bars are good up to three bars, no more. Why? Because it\u2019s difficult to compare the heights of any of the bars except for the bottom bar, rifles in this case.  Let\u2019s go through several alternative displays. If you\u2019re interested in playing with the data, Matt published it here for me. Thank you Matt! All of the charts below were built with Tableau . You can view an interactive version of all of these charts here and download the workbook here . Let\u2019s start with a redesigned stacked bar chart that uses Tableau\u2019s built-in color blind palette.  Can you see the trends for each of the weapons? Maybe an area chart would be better.  Well, ok. Now the trends are easier to see, right? Area charts certainly improve the ability to see trends over time, but there are only two trends that give an accurate reading:  The line at the top of the bottom area, i.e., rifles. The top of the top chart, which represents the total. We still don\u2019t have the ability to see the trends for any weapon except for rifles.  Before you read on, take out a piece of paper and sketch what you think the trend is for shotguns (light blue) based on the area chart above. Ok. Now let\u2019s compare the area chart above with the area chart for shotguns.  Did you come close? I doubt you did. Why? Because the tops of each color are influenced by the size of the colors below it, therefore making gauging the true size of each individual color extremely difficult. Here\u2019s another way to prove it. I know this isn\u2019t a good way to represent the data, but bear with me, I\u2019m trying to prove a point. If I overlay lines for each weapon over the area chart, look how different the shapes of the lines become.  Like most time-series data, your best way to represent the data is nearly always going to be a line chart.   Using a line chart we can quickly make some observations:  There was a three-year spike in the early 90s for pistols made and there\u2019s been a similar, but longer, surge since 2006. What was the cause of the big decline in 1995? Was there a change in handgun laws in 2005 or 2006?  Revolvers were on a steady 20-year decline until 2005-2006. Is this merely coincidental with the pistols? Possibly so, possibly not.  Rifles have increased recently, but shotguns have decreased. Are people buying rifles instead of shotguns? Their rate of variance since 1994 has grown consistently and the gap continues to get wider. Using a line chart, you\u2019re immediately asking questions of your data. Rapid-fire analysis! When analyzing time-series data across several categories, consider not only looking at the raw numbers like above, but also review how each category contributes to the total. Let\u2019s go through the same series of charts.  We\u2019re off to a good start with the stacked bar chart. It looks like measuring the contribution of each weapon to the total may tell us something. Let\u2019s try it as an area chart.  Not much better, other than it looks smoother. How about a line chart?  Ok, now we\u2019re onto something. You might think that this is the same as the line chart for the raw numbers, and I can see how you might make that conclusion at a quick glance. But let\u2019s look at them side-by-side.  The charts look very similar up until 1997, but then look at how many more rifles started to be made compared to the rest. And look at the drop off in percentage of shotguns produced since 2004. Hopefully you\u2019ve learned two main lessons:  Don\u2019t display time-series data as stacked bars (or pies unrolled onto on a stick if you prefer). The best medium for time-series data is a line chart. Consider looking at both the raw numbers and their contribution to the total. It\u2019s always a good idea to look at your data in more than one way. You may get some additional and/or different insights. Let me wrap with two charts that disturbed me a bit as I was playing with the data for this blog post. I\u2019m not disturbed by their visual display, but by what they reveal.  The chart on the left is the running total of guns made by gun type since 1986. The chart on the right summarizes the chart on the left. These charts tell us that the US has manufactured over 99 million guns since 1986. Seriously! 99 million! According to the US Census Bureau , there were ~238M Americans over 18. That means that approximately one of every five Americans 18 or older owns a gun.  That terrifies me! Perhaps political interests (and lobbyists) have played a part??  UPDATE \u2013 Source CNN : This certainly explains the drop that started in 1994 and the subsequent increase in 2005.  The Clinton administration imposed a ban on several types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines in 1994, but that ban was allowed to lapse in 2004. Obama has proposed restoring the ban, requiring background checks for buyers at gun shows, and other \"common-sense measures.\""], "link": "http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/feeds/4564773820870427754/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://thedailyviz.com/": 3, "http://articles.cnn.com/": 1, "http://public.tableausoftware.com/": 2, "http://www.atf.gov/": 1, "http://www.tableausoftware.com/": 1, "http://twitter.com/": 1, "http://goo.gl/": 1, "http://quickfacts.census.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "VizWiz"}, {"content": ["Situation: You have daily sales data, but you don\u2019t want to include the current week until it closes.

Instead you want the user to be able to pick the measure to view. Parameters to the rescue! Andy Cotgreave blogged about user built views in his Data Studio days. In this blog post I will provide the step-by-step directions. The charts types you can create with the technique are seemingly endless, but I\u2019ll go through a simple scenario. Step 1 \u2013 Right-click anywhere in the Measures or Dimensions windows and choose Create Parameter. Create a parameter named \u201cChoose a measure\u201d with the settings below. Note that I am giving this a name that will instruction the user as to what to do.  Step 2 \u2013 Find the parameter you just created in the Parameters window. Right-click on it and choose \u201cCreate Calculated Field\u201d. Step 3 \u2013 Use a CASE statement to build the calculated field. This field is telling Tableau what measure to use based on the value chosen in the \u201cChoose a measure\u201d parameter.  Step 4 \u2013 Add Order Date to the column shelf and your new \u201cMeasure chosen\u201d measure to the row shelf. For this example, I\u2019ve expanded the Order Date field to Quarter.  Notice how the y-axis is labeled \u201cMeasure chosen\u201d. We\u2019ll clean that up in a bit. Step 5 \u2013 Right-click on your \u201cChoose a measure\u201d parameter in the Parameter window and choose \u201cShow Parameter Control\u201d. It should appear on the upper-right of the window.  Make different selections in the parameter control and notice how the y-axis and the chart change dynamically. Step 6 \u2013 Drag the \u201cChoose a measure\u201d parameter to the row shelf. Again, make different selections in the parameter control and watch the label change. We\u2019re almost done. Just a bit of formatting remains. Step 7 \u2013 Clean up the chart.  Right-click on the field that shows the \u201cChoose a measure\u201d value and select \u201cRotate Label\u201d  Right-click on the row label and choose \u201cHide Labels for Rows\u201d.  Double-click on the \u201cMeasure Chosen\u201d axis to bring up the Edit Axis window. Delete the title. That\u2019s it. You\u2019re final viz should look like this:   If you\u2019re like me, once you saw this technique, you began thinking of all of the possible uses. Play around with lots of different use cases. Try scatter plots, dual-axis charts, bubble charts, etc. You can control ANY of the shelves using parameters. Imagine the guided analysis you can provide your users and the exploration they\u2019ll be able to do on their own. It\u2019s almost like creating a pivot table for them.  If you want a slightly more complex version, I created a scatterplot of NBA franchise values that allows you pick the x-axis, y-axis and size, all with parameters. Parameters are quite powerful.

When those questions are about Tableau, I\u2019m nearly always convinced that what the person is trying to do can be done. Wednesday was another great example. Assume you have a table that measures sales by year by customer. You\u2019re only interested in customers that have more than $35,000 in sales per year.  And you don\u2019t care who the customers are, just how many. Restating the question: How many customers have bought over $35,000 of products in a year and what was the total value of those sales? This is a simple question, but it wasn\u2019t as easy to do in Tableau as I thought. My initial thought was to simply change the Customers field to a distinct count, but that didn\u2019t work because my individual customers are no longer listed. Ok, so I need all of the customers, but I don\u2019t want to see them. Basically I\u2019m looking for one row for each year. Each row will list year, # of customers over $35K, and total sales for those customers. Here\u2019s how to do it. I\u2019m going to assume that you are starting with a view like this.  Step 1 \u2013 Create a calculated field to count all of the customers in the view (note that I\u2019m working with an Excel data source, so COUNTD is only available if I make it an extract).   Step 2 \u2013 Drop the Customer Count measure onto the data area. You will see the Customer Count field appear in the Measure Values shelf. Step 3 \u2013 Right-click on the Customer Count measure in the Measure Values shelf and choose Edit Table Calculation.  From the Compute Using list, choose Advanced\u2026 Move the Year of Order Date and Customer fields to the right and click OK.  On the Table Calculation window, change the Restarting every option to Year of Order Date and click OK.  Your view should now look like this. Notice how the Customer Count field shows the same total number of Customers in each row for each year.  Step 4 \u2013 Create a calculated field to total all of the sales in the view   Step 5 \u2013 Drop the Total Sales measure onto the data area. You will see the Total Sales field appear in the Measure Values shelf. Step 6 \u2013 Right-click on the Total Sales measure in the Measure Values shelf and choose Edit Table Calculation.  From the Compute Using list, choose Advanced\u2026 Move the Year of Order Date and Customer fields to the right and click OK.   On the Table Calculation window, change the Restarting every option to Year of Order Date and click OK.  Your view should now look like this. Notice how the Total Sales field now shows to total sales by year on each row.   Step 7 \u2013 Drop the Number of Records measure onto the data area. You will see the Number of Records field appear in the Measure Values shelf. Step 8 \u2013 Right-click on the Number of Records measure in the Measure Values shelf and change the aggregation from Sum to Average. Step 9 \u2013 Right-click on the Number of Records measure in the Measure Values shelf and choose Add Table Calculation.  Change the Calculation Type to Running Total. From the Running Along list, choose Advanced\u2026 Move the Year of Order Date and Customer fields to the right and click OK.   On the Table Calculation window, change the Restarting every option to Year of Order Date and click OK.  Your view should now look like this. Notice the running total we\u2019ve added and how it restarts every year. What we\u2019re doing here is simply counting the number of rows in each pane.   Step 10 \u2013 Cleanup time!  Right-click on the Number of Records pill and choose Filter. Change the filter to be At Most 1. This will now keep only the first row in each year.  Notice how our Customer Count and Total Sales fields didn\u2019t change. This is because we still have the Customers dimension in the view. Drag the Number of Records pill off of the Measure Values shelf. Be sure to keep it on the filter shelf though. Note: Steps 7 to 10.1 could all be combined into one step if we put the Number of Records field in the filter immediately. I didn\u2019t do that because I wanted to demonstrate how we\u2019re leveraging the running totals calculation in this example. Move the Customers dimension from the Row shelf to the Level of Detail shelf. Remove Sum of Sales from the view. It\u2019s no longer relevant. Right click on the two headers for the measures and rename them (Edit Alias). That\u2019s it!  I have a sneaking suspicion that I\u2019m overlooking a very simple way to do this, so if I am, please let me know. Either way, this works.

It\u2019s very rare that I can\u2019t either (1) find the answer or (2) get the answer by starting a discussion. Now, consider that you have a stacked bar chart of sales by Product Container color-coded by Region.  Great! But it would be more useful to label the top of each bar with the totals sales like this.  Awesome! I was banging my head trying to figure out how to make this work. Adding totals to a stacked bar is straight forward, but the trick here is that the bars represent % of total, not the raw sales. It seems so simple, but I was stumped.

Change the mark type to Bar.   Step 7 \u2013 Scroll to the right again to get to AVG(One).  Remove Region from the Color shelf Set the color transparency to 0% Change the mark type to Gantt Bar ( Joe Mako suggested using Gantt Bar instead of Bar because it creates a line at the top and it will eliminate the chance that the user could select a hidden bar.) Drag the Sales measure onto the Label shelf Set the Label alignment to Top   You should now have a chart that looks like this:   Step 8 \u2013 Right-click on the right axis and uncheck Show Header That\u2019s it!

I can assure you, I\u2019ve given them plenty. Here\u2019s an alternative that I threw together in Tableau .    It\u2019s important when creating a visualization that you design it in such a way that, amongst many other things, (1) the reader can see the whole story at a glance, and (2) they can interact for their own deeper analysis. To accomplish this I:  Started with maps (This is a global report with geographic data, which always leads me to start with a map) Made very specific color choices to emphasize the positives (blue) and the negatives (red) Added interactivity through highlighting Included a scatterplot to compare the change to the index Provided the option to filter by continent Why is all of this important? Because we need to know how consumers\u2019 feeling are trending; a country could have a high index, but are headed down (e.g. India and China), or a country could have a low index and things are looking up (e.g., South Korea and France). Those are two very different stories. Imagine how the politicians could spin this information.

Naturally, you click on the Sort Descending button, but, uh oh, you get this:  What happened? The bars are not sorted by Product Sub-Category within each Customer Segment. They\u2019re actually sorted by the total of the Product Sub-Category across the entire table.  What we really want is for the Product Sub-Categories to be sorted within each Customer Segment. To do that, you need to create a set. Step 1 \u2013 Choose the two fields you want to create the set with, then right-click and choose Create Set.  Step 2 \u2013 Give the set a name if you want, rearrange them to the proper order and click ok.   NOTE: If the columns are not in the order you want, then simply drag them left and/or right. In our example, we want Customer Segment first because that is our first level dimension.

Step 4 \u2013 Clear the sort from the Product Sub-Category dimension, then right-click on the Set on the Rows shelf and choose Sort. Set the sort order to descending by Sales.  Your chart is now sorted by Product Sub-Category within each Customer Segment.  Step 5 \u2013 Clean up the chart by right-clicking on your set in the Rows shelf and uncheck Show Header.

Step 6 \u2013 Create a parameter to allow the user to choose between the top 1 and the top 10.  Step 7 \u2013 Create a \u201crank\u201d field that will show you the rank of each Product Sub-Category within each Customer Segment.  Step 8 \u2013 Add the Rank measure to the Level of Detail shelf. Step 9 \u2013 Edit the Rank field by right-clicking on the Rank field and choosing Edit Table Calculation. Choose Advanced from the Computing using list.  In the Advanced window, move both fields into the Compute Using box and change the Order Along section to Sales descending. Click OK.  Now updated the Rank table calculation to the following:  Basically what this is saying is that the Rank field should compute for each Product Sub-Category within a Customer Segment, then it should restart counting when it gets to the next Customer Segment. Step 10 \u2013 Create a calculated field that uses the Top X parameter to filter the number of Product Sub-Categories that should be displayed within each Customer Segment.  This creates a true/false filter. Step 11 \u2013 Add the Top X ? true/false calculated field to the Filter shelf and select True. Step 12 \u2013 Show the Top X parameter control created in Step 6 and you\u2019re done!

I\u2019m hopping back into the blog saddle with a series of posts about different charts type, their strengths and weaknesses, when to/not to use them, etc.  The posts will include step-by-step instructions for creating the charts in Tableau . The instructions for many of these charts have been written before and I will reference the authors whenever I know about their work. I will typically use a chart I\u2019ve found on the internet in order to provide variety of examples and also to provide a forum for discussing the strengths and weaknesses of their chosen designs. Let\u2019s get right to it with this lollipop chart from The Washington Post (via Chart Porn ):  I like the clean design, the use of simple colors, and the excellent use of data-ink ratio of this chart, but there are few issues that immediately stand out to me. First though, what is a lollipop chart? I couldn\u2019t find an exact definition, but I think of a lollipop chart as a combination of a bar chart and a dot plot. Lollipop charts are great for giving you a sense of both length (bars) and precision (dots).  However, it only makes sense to use the stick of the lollipop when you\u2019re range starts at zero.  In the example above, the bars start at 60, therefore including the bars could mislead the reader into thinking the retirement age in Malta is five times lower than Austria. In this example, the bars should be removed, which turns the chart into a dot plot. Another problem with this chart is that there is no particular rationale to the sort. At first I thought it was ranked buy retirement age from youngest to oldest, but then Spain was listed before the United States. For the purpose of the rest of this blog post, we\u2019re going to focus on the retirement age only. Taking the issues above into account, the data could be represented as a simple dot plot:  Or alternatively as a lollipop chart:  Hopefully at this point you understand when and why you would use a lollipop chart. In the end, it\u2019s basically a bar chart with a bit more emphasis on the exact value of the bar. CAUTION: Don\u2019t avoid a bar chart simply because a lollipop chart looks cute. I would nearly always prefer a bar chart over a lollipop chart. So now onto the instructions for how to build this chart. (Credit to Andy Cotgreave , who back in his days at The Data Studio wrote similar instructions ) Step 1 \u2013 Drag the Country dimension onto the Rows shelf and the Retirement Age measure onto the Columns shelf. The result is a bar chart. Click the sort ascending button.  Step 2 \u2013 Drag the Retirement Age measure to the Columns shelf again. The results is the same bar chart side-by-side.  Step 3 \u2013 Right-click on the 2nd Retirement Age measure on the Columns shelf and choose Dual Axis  Step 4 - Right-click on the 2nd Retirement Age measure on the Columns shelf and choose Synchronize Axis Step 5 - Right-click on the 2nd Retirement Age measure on the Columns shelf and uncheck Show Header Step 6 \u2013 Drag the right side of the chart to the left to shrink the view  Step 7 \u2013 On the Marks card, click on the triangle (a.k.a. carrot) on the upper-right and choose Multiple Mark Types  The Marks card should now show \u201cAll\u201d at the top and there are now arrows for moving left and right through the measures on the Column shelf, e.g., the two Retirement Ages measures.

I thought for sure that San Francisco would be in the top 50 (we had some serious sticker shock look at houses out there!!), but it\u2019s not. Select data was released by the Guardian . They posted this infographic (click to enlarge), but I found it a bit difficult to circumnavigate. It\u2019s challenging to find patterns and compare the data. For me, there\u2019s too much information in one view. It\u2019s good for an overview and to print, but challenging for analysis. Note that the data is a subset of countries; it does not represent the top 50.   I downloaded the data and built this simple viz in Tableau .   Powered by Tableau  I wanted to be able to compare countries and two expenditures simultaneously, so I used Tableau\u2019s parameters feature to allow you to choose the what you want to compare. I intentionally included both a map and scatterplot so that you have multiple methods for comparing the data. Click on a country on the map or a circle in the scatterplot to highlight the country. Hover over a circle for more information. The 2nd tab is a reproduction of the infographic the Guardian produced. It\u2019s for reference only. I doubt you can glean much insight from it. There are some expenditures that I would have expected to correlate highly that don\u2019t. Blue jeans vs. cinema is a good example of this. Or a cup of coffee and a newspaper.

Donut charts are used to display data in rings, where each ring represents a data series. Each ring is a distinct category. Yes, there are examples of donuts within donuts ( here is a particularly horrific example from Dundas ).  Once again, Nielsen provides another example to pick on review. At least their consistent in their ineffectiveness, right?  Pie charts can be effective, rarely, but I don\u2019t see why you would ever use a donut chart over a pie chart. Let\u2019s look at some alternatives to Nielsen\u2019s infographic. Alternative 1 \u2013 Pie Chart   Grade = F  It\u2019s a pie chart It\u2019s a pie chart It\u2019s a pie chart  Alternative 2 \u2013 Bar chart by Device by Category   Grade = C  Comparisons between Devices is difficult Data is sorted by frequency of using the Device, making it harder to see the winners and losers The coloring by Category is distracting  Alternative 3 \u2013 Bar chart by Category by Device   Grade = B  Easy to compare devices, which was the point of the article Labels removed since the exact values are not all that important and distract from comparing the size of the bars Devices are sorted by frequency within each Category, making it easy to see the winners and losers in each Category The colors neatly segment the data  Alternative 4 \u2013 Heat Map   Grade = A  Easy to compare all of the data at once, whether you want to look vertically, horizontally or both. A heat map makes it clear that people use their computers at home to watch video most frequently and that people watch a LOT of video, independent of the device. The colors are impactful and provide rich meaning, while not overwhelming your eyes.  Alternative 5 \u2013 Highlight Table   Grade = A+  You get all of the benefits of the heat map, but you also get the values, providing additional detail. These are only five of the many possible alternatives. Download the Tableau workbook here . Would you use any of these charts to visualize this data? Why or why not?

However, if you have multiple data sources and multiple worksheets, global filters do not apply to all of your worksheets. Yes, you can use actions, but this can easily become confusing for the user when switching worksheets. But wouldn\u2019t it be great to have a global filter work across all of the data sources? Use this technique and you\u2019ll get what you always hoped for. In this example, assume you have three disparate data sources each with its own dashboard.      There is also a dimension named Location in all of the data sources. Note that this dimension does not have to be named the same in every data source for this technique to work.   At this point, if I add the Location dimension to the Sales worksheets and set it to a global filter, the filter will not get applied to the Shipping and Capacity dashboards because they are not from the same data source.  To make a \u201cglobal filter\u201d apply to all of the dashboards/worksheets, follow these steps. Step 1 \u2013 Drag the Location dimension onto the filter shelf of one worksheet for each data source and choose the Use All option.   Step 2 \u2013 Make the Location field a Global filter on each data source   Remember, you must repeat steps 1 & 2 for one sheet of each data source. Step 3 \u2013 Create a parameter named Location (or any name you\u2019d like) with the following settings.   Of course, your list of values will need to be relevant to your data. Step 4 \u2013 Create a calculated field that will determine if the Location dimension equals the value chosen in the Location parameter.   Step 5 \u2013 Copy/Paste this formula across all of the data sources. You should now have the Location Flag calculated field in the Dimensions list of each data source. Step 6 - Drag the Location Flag dimension onto the filter shelf of one worksheet for each data source and choose True.   Step 7 \u2013 Make the Location Flag a Global filter on each data source Step 8 \u2013 Show the Location parameter in each dashboard and place it on the dashboard wherever you prefer.   The Location parameter now acts like a Compact List quick filter. Your final workbook should look like this:    Powered by Tableau  Choose a different Location, then flip to another tab. You will see the dashboard update based on the new Location. Change it back if you don\u2019t believe me. In this example, I did not want to allow the user to pick \u201cAll\u201d as an option in the Location parameter. Instead I wanted them to be forced to pick only one Area. You could include an All option through a few more calculated fields."], "link": "http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/feeds/4932175457502363439/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://lh4.ggpht.com/": 3, "http://vizwiz.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.tableausoftware.com/": 1, "http://lh6.ggpht.com/": 3, "http://lh3.ggpht.com/": 2, "http://lh5.ggpht.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "VizWiz"}]
