The phyletic distribution suggested it was acquired more recently and couple from lateral gene transfer. This acquisition likely helps the microsporidia cells obtain nucleosides from the host since the parasite cannot synthesize these. There is also evidence of evolution of microsporidia-specific secretion signals in the hexokinases which may be a mechanism for delivery of these enzymes into host cells to catalyze rapid growth once inside the host.

Several new genome sequences were described from Athlete\u2019s foot, microsporida that infect C. elegans , basal Mucormycotina, and dandruff causing Malassezia fungi. \n I also want to highlight that this has been one of the most organized and well run conferences I have been to in a while. The Interplan conference organizer really has done an excellent job and the bcc conference venue in Berlin is really well equipped. Let\u2019s see more conferences in Berlin please!"], "link": "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2012/06/hello-from-isham-2012/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.bcc-berlin.de/": 1, "http://www.ac.uk/": 1, "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog": 1, "http://www.ucd.ie/": 1, "http://www.nih.gov/": 1, "http://isham2012.org/": 2, "http://www.interplan.de/": 1, "http://www.jubilekinase.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Hyphal Tip"}, {"content": ["\u201c@mycologymycoses: Fungal evangelists needed!! # isham2012 ?? \u2013 we hope http://t.co/OxYH1daU can help spread the word! # \n \n Powered by Twitter Tools"], "link": "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2012/06/the-roundup-of-twittered-updates-for-2012-06-12-2/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://twitter.com/": 1, "http://alexking.org/": 1, "http://t.co/": 1, "http://search.twitter.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Hyphal Tip"}, {"content": ["Fleming's penicillin producing strain is not Penicillium chrysogenum but P. rubens http://t.co/OwULKFfn # \n Genetic and genomic glimpses of the elusive arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi http://t.co/zZaGYe1m # \n \n Powered by Twitter Tools"], "link": "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2012/06/the-roundup-of-twittered-updates-for-2012-06-11-2/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://twitter.com/": 2, "http://alexking.org/": 1, "http://t.co/": 2}, "blogtitle": "The Hyphal Tip"}, {"content": ["Mucormycosis of Platypus http://t.co/vXPMgNoL and shrinking populations and loss of genetic diversity in Platypus http://t.co/Ozzqca5g # \n \n Powered by Twitter Tools"], "link": "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2012/06/the-roundup-of-twittered-updates-for-2012-06-06-2/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://twitter.com/": 1, "http://alexking.org/": 1, "http://t.co/": 2}, "blogtitle": "The Hyphal Tip"}, {"content": ["The Black Queen Hypothesis: Evolution of Dependencies through Adaptive Gene Loss http://t.co/4HrbkWN9 # \n The Origins of Cooperative Bacterial Communities http://t.co/3vRjOkN3 # \n \n Powered by Twitter Tools"], "link": "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2012/06/the-roundup-of-twittered-updates-for-2012-06-05-4/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://twitter.com/": 2, "http://alexking.org/": 1, "http://t.co/": 2}, "blogtitle": "The Hyphal Tip"}, {"content": ["TriAnnot: A Versatile and High Performance Pipeline for the Automated Annotation of Plant Genomes http://t.co/ELDZ0KU4 # \n \n Powered by Twitter Tools"], "link": "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2012/06/the-roundup-of-twittered-updates-for-2012-06-04-2/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://twitter.com/": 1, "http://alexking.org/": 1, "http://t.co/": 1}, "blogtitle": "The Hyphal Tip"}, {"content": ["Excellent PLoS Pearl: \"Hydrophobins\u2014Unique Fungal Proteins\" http://t.co/JJYPhRCM # \n Extracellular Superoxide Dismutase Protects Histoplasma Yeast Cells from Host-Derived Oxidative Stress http://t.co/ruje6VDk # \n Global Analysis of the Evolution and Mechanism of Echinocandin Resistance in Candida glabrata http://t.co/jCJvPAR2 # \n LargeScale Gene Disruption M.oryzae Ids MC69,a Secreted Protein Req'd for Infection by Monocot & Dicot Fungal Pathogens http://t.co/Sn1oVJFA # \n \n Powered by Twitter Tools"], "link": "http://fungalgenomes.org/blog/2012/06/the-roundup-of-twittered-updates-for-2012-06-02-2/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://twitter.com/": 4, "http://alexking.org/": 1, "http://t.co/": 4}, "blogtitle": "The Hyphal Tip"}]
