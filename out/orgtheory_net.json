My argument was fairly straightforward. Academia is worse than the other major alternatives in every major measure \u2013 time to graduation, % of people who complete the program, getting a job after graduation, and income. I think I am right about the comparison overall. Medical school graduates have a 90%+ graduate rate after 5 years and almost always land jobs or internships. \n However, I have revised my assessment of law school. It is much, much worse than I knew about. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as bad as academia. For example, the typical law school student will actually get the degree, while most PhD students never finish up \u2013 and they waste many years trying. And, there is actually an extremely well paid elite law track, which doesn\u2019t exist in academia, except in the medical schools. But still, the legal market is now starting to resemble academia in that those at the top have many good career opportunities, while the rest have poor opportunities, unemployment, and ever increasing debt. \n If you want a good summary of the issue, read the blog \u201c Inside the Law School Scam \u201d by law professor Paul Campos . It boils down to the following: \n \n The recession contracted the entire legal services market. \n A lot of work previously done by young lawyers is now done by computers, paralegals, English speakers in India, and other non-JDs. \n Corporate clients are not willing to pay top dollar for on the job training for young associates. \n \n As a consequence of these trends, law firms, corporate legal counsel offices, and other employers have reduced their positions or cut salaries. Also, the rate at which people make \u201cpartner,\u201d has gone down since firms can\u2019t take on so many senior associates. \n We now have an emerging two-tier structure in the law market that resembles academia. Graduates of the top 20 or so programs still have great opportunities \u2013 prestigious clerkships, fast tracks in New York or DC firms, and teaching gigs at law schools. But one you get past this tier, it gets brutal, really brutal. People working for $15/hour doing \u201cdocument review,\u201d which is like being a grad school research assistant. Many graduates spend years finding a job requiring a JD.

One of the special issue co-editors is George Cheney , who published Values at Work (Cornell University Press) about how the Mondragon cooperatives in Basque, Spain have dealt with global competition. \n The submission deadlines is Feb. 23, 2013. (Other calls for papers in Organization are here .) \n \u201cCall for Papers \u2013 Special Issue of Organization \n \n Worker cooperatives as an organizational alternative: \nChallenges, achievements and promise in organizational governance and ownership \n Deadline 28th February 2013 \nGuest Editors \n I\u00f1aki Santa Cruz.

Professor, Centre for Co-operative and Community Based Economy and Gustavson School of Business, University of Victoria (Canada) \n The current financial crisis has revealed structural problems as well as perturbations in the global financial and market systems. Within the context of crisis, there is great interest in experimentation with alternative organizational forms that can both respond to the challenges of today\u2019s economy and restore equilibrium through a renewed emphasis on social values. In particular, worker ownership and governance are gaining attention in a variety of forms and regions. Worker-owned-and-governed cooperatives typically pursue both economic viability and strong forms of participation; further, they are closely tied to community economic and social development. Seeing these multiple objectives as intertwined and in fact necessary is central to the call for the 2012 United Nations\u2019 International Year of the Cooperative, which seeks to highlight the contribution of cooperatives to social and economic development through generating employment, reducing poverty, and fostering social integration. \n Perhaps the most famous contemporary case of worker cooperative organization that achieves the multiple goals described above is the Mondragon Cooperative Group (MCG), one of the largest, long-lived, and successful examples of workers\u2019 owned organizations in the entire world. Mondragon has a remarkable record of financial success and the provision of sound and stable labour conditions. Founded in 1956, the Basque cooperatives now employ almost 100,000 members, are represented in more than a dozen countries, and are the focus of ongoing scrutiny, praise, and critique. While the well-known wage differential has grown somewhat over the years within the system, it remains quite narrow by almost any comparison, even when a number of top-level salaries that are pegged to the market are taken into account. Amidst the current economic downturn that began in 2007 that has resulted in over 20% unemployment in Spain and approximately half that in the Basque Country, the Mondragon co-ops have relied on their historic principles of democracy, equality, solidarity, and participation as fundamental parts of their management strategy. While 24% of Spanish companies have closed down during this recession, the MCG only had to close down one of the 120 cooperatives that form the group, and relocate the 35 workers into other companies. In fact, there is significant evidence of increased democratization in the FAGOR Group, the original industrial cooperatives and the heart of the system. For all these reasons, now is an important moment for attention to the distinctive characteristics of these cooperatives as well as their lessons for other socially inspired management, organizational, and market models. The MCG represents but one case; however, given its rich history, diverse characteristics, encounters with globalization, and experimentation in new forms of participation now underway, it provides an extremely important point of reference in any comprehensive or forward-looking examination of worker cooperatives today. \n This call for papers is open to research contributions and critical-theoretical analyses of alternative organizations and especially worker cooperatives. We are especially interested in nuanced assessments of the methodological, philosophical, socio-political and organizational principles and challenges of workers cooperatives within the broader context of so-called alternative organizations. This means that sound empirical and interpretive investigations in the pursuit of important critical questions are encouraged. Such assessments may include attention to the activities, performance, and extensions of this kind of alternative organizations. We welcome multidisciplinary contributions and those that take on different perspectives that seek to bridge case-level detail with broader socio-economic trends. In addition, papers presenting theoretical reflections and analyses of specific worker owned cooperatives worldwide (such as Mondragon) should manifest a comparative perspective even if they do not fully examine each of two or multiple cases. Analyses that seek to apply recent developments in democratic theory and in alternative economics are certainly appropriate. Overall, the set of papers in the special issue will illuminate the complexities and changes in worker cooperatives, as they weather an extremely challenging period yet one ripe with opportunity. \n The special issue will reflect the international scope of Organization, advancing its mission as an open, reflective, imaginative, and critical journal about what is happening worldwide that contributes to these reflections. Further, we aim to help to expand the field of organization studies by interrogating the diversity and comparative viability and authenticity of organizational forms and practices, including those grounded in deep forms of democracy and solidarity. By closely examining cooperative organizations, and comparing them with other forms of worker ownership and governance, the special issue will encourage further exploration of diverse forms of organization, managerial practice, and the social economy from all around the globe, widening research on the Mondragon Cooperative Experience (MCE) and other significant examples. Therefore, the call welcomes international collaborations, be they ongoing or ad hoc. \n Examples of key themes for investigation allowing for further international comparisons include: \n 1. The organizational resources, structures, and dynamics allowing for social as well as economic resilience in worker cooperatives; \n 2. The changing roles of leadership in worker cooperatives: considering for example the interplay of various forms of leadership from charismatic to collaborative or group-based; \n 3. The capacity of and obstacles to the reinvention of democracy within cooperatives, including means to manage and solve conflicts between different goals, sectors, and constituencies (for example, concerning the relationship between worker-member-owners and temporary workers); \n 4. The relationships between cooperatives and organized labour, the state, the community, and the larger financial system; \n 5. Maintaining cooperative values while facing crises of participation, identity, and shared ownership and decision making within a system undergoing international expansion. \n Submission: Papers must be submitted electronically by 28th February 2013 to SAGETrack at http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/organization \n Papers should be no more than 8,000 words, excluding references, and will be blind reviewed following the journal\u2019s standard procedures.

Within them, workers are sorted into pyramid-shaped hierarchies where a privileged few at the top garner disproportionate perks from their status.\u00a0 Executives benefit from skyrocketing levels of\u00a0 compensation that are not tightly coupled with sustained company performance, while those at the lower rungs of the firm receive stagnant wages, declining benefits, and less security despite overall increases in labor productivity over the past 30 years.\u00a0\u00a0 At first glance, it\u2019s logical to assume that the prevalence of large-scale corporate enterprises in a society would be associated with greater levels of inequality. \n One afternoon, Jerry Davis (my recovering advisor and current co-conspirator in this research) and I began thinking about this question in detail.\u00a0 Jerry had recently finished his book tour for Managed by Markets , which chronicled the decline of the large corporation and concomitant rise of finance as the central institution in US society.\u00a0 We discussed how income inequality rose during a period when financial markets took an increasingly large role in redefining the purpose of the firm \u2013 the corporation was no longer a stabilizing institution providing large numbers of quality jobs, retirement and health care, and opportunities for advancement and mobility.\u00a0 Could rising income inequality be a consequence these changes?\u00a0\u00a0 Our hunch was yes. \n \n Whereas economic theory explains wage differentials to variations in labor supply and productivity, the structuralist approach in sociology argues that organizations are the central source of inequality because firms provide unequal access to remuneration, rewards and opportunities for advancement.\u00a0 Organizations and their practices, therefore, have much to inform us about societal-levels of income inequality.\u00a0 How corporate size relates to inequality is because large organizations are more likely to standardize their employment practices through bureaucratized procedures.\u00a0 They are also more likely to utilize internal labor markets (ILMs) in which workers are buffered from the vagaries of market forces.\u00a0 ILMs also provide a clear pathway for mobility \u2013 jobs are organized into promotion ladders that enable workers to move upward through the corporate ranks.\u00a0 As more employees are brought within the boundaries of a single organization, their remuneration and opportunities for advancement are standardized.\u00a0 Extremes at the top and bottom of a country\u2019s income distribution are most likely to occur outside of bureaucratized corporations.\u00a0 The top end consists of winner-take-all markets, investment partnerships and other boutique firms where the spoils are shared by a relatively small number.\u00a0 The very bottom is characterized by low wages and economic insecurity.\u00a0 Workers in large corporations are more likely to occupy the middle. \n In a recent study , Jerry and I tested this hypothesis.\u00a0 We operationalized the presence of large corporations in a society by creating a measure of employment concentration \u2013 the proportion of the labor force employed by the largest 10, 25, or 50 firms \u2013 and tested whether this has any relationship with a country\u2019s level of inequality.\u00a0 The results are startling and indicate an almost mechanical relationship between inequality and employment concentration in the US over time \n Three-Year Moving Average of Income Inequality and Employment Concentration in the United States, 1950 \u2013 2008 \n \n  \n Cross-national results, while less straightforward, are also suggestive. \n Cross-National Comparison of Income Inequality and Employment Concentration \n  \n The observed pattern indicates a \u2018\u2018wedge\u2019\u2019: low employment concentration is compatible with both great inequality (Latin America) and relative equality (the former state socialist countries), but high concentration seems to drive out inequality. (Preliminary cross-national, longitudinal work suggests that this relationship is equally as strong in the\u00a0 UK ( \u03c1 = -.75) as in the US ( \u03c1 = -.81), though much less so in Canada ( \u03c1 = -20).) There exist a number of alternative explanations for these findings and while space constraints limit my ability to discuss those here, we do our best to account for those both empirically and conceptually in our paper. \n I do not wish to romanticize the halcyon days where large corporations dominated the societal landscape.\u00a0 However, the results here suggest that a society\u2019s level of corporate employment is negatively associated with inequality.\u00a0 Future work in this area will help uncover when, where and under what conditions these relationships hold. \n [Shameless plug]\u00a0 Currently, I am developing a website to serve as a portal where researchers can find, access and contribute data and research to the study of this topic.\u00a0 It should be up soon, so check out http://www.worldinequality.net in the next few weeks! \n \n Discussion by Leslie McCall \n Organizational sociologists have long studied the relationship between organizations and labor market structures, including labor market inequalities and insecurities of many kinds. Until recently, however, they have been relatively absent from debates over the causes and consequences of rising economic inequality.\u00a0 No doubt this reflects the difficulties of measuring corporate-level changes in a manner that isolates their unique impact on aggregate levels of economic inequality. \n In the absence of such aggregate, organization-level data, scholars interested in understanding the social dynamics of rising inequality have focused on the impact of changes in families, unions, the minimum wage, partisan shifts, tax policy, and other major social and political institutions. I come back to politics at the end, but for the moment I simply want to emphasize that economists and political scientists already recognize that institutional factors are important in shaping the rise of earnings and income inequality. Current debates revolve around which institutions matter the most, and when and why they do, as the trend in rising inequality varies considerably over time and depending on the measure of inequality (e.g., earnings inequality versus family income inequality, the 50 th /10 th ratio versus the share of income held by the top .01%). \n It is especially in this light that Davis and Cobb\u2019s research is so welcome, given its international and historical scope. If they can help explain both the ups in the 1980s and the downs in the 1960s in the U.S., in addition to cross-national variation, that would be impressive indeed. The considerable empirical evidence they harness does suggest that employment concentration in large firms is associated with income inequality. And so this\u2014employment concentration\u2014 might represent one of the best ways that organizational sociologists can begin to measure organizational change and its connection to aggregate inequality. \n In the spirit of furthering this broader project, I want to say a bit more about Davis and Cobb\u2019s findings, their explanations of these findings, and how their research squares with the research of a small but hopefully growing number of other sociologists studying the impact of corporate structure on inequality (and here I focus mainly on the U.S.). \n First, in terms of the findings, the figure of trends in employment concentration and income inequality in the U.S. appears most convincing in the period from 1950 to the late 1980s (see also Figure 7 in the published paper). It is especially interesting to observe the decline in employment concentration in the 1970s prior to the steep rise in inequality in the 1980s, as one would expect this lag in cause and effect. It is also widely assumed that the 1970s were a \u201cpivotal decade\u201d in terms of setting the stage for rising inequality. \n But thereafter, the measure of employment concentration flattens out even though income inequality continues to rise, albeit less steeply than in the 1980s (note that the sharp increase in the early nineties is due to a change in the Census Bureau\u2019s methods). \n This latter period coincides with evidence of the declining significance of large firms in shaping the structure of wages and inequality. Matissa Hollister shows that the well-known wage premium accruing to workers in large firms declined from the late 1980s to the 1990s. And a paper she presented at the 2012 ASA meetings gives a new clue as to why: managers as a share of employment declined in large firms but rose in small firms, adding nuance to Adam Goldstein\u2019s recent evidence in support of David Gordon\u2019s Fat and Mean hypothesis . \n In an earlier ASA paper , I explored the effect of establishment size on earnings inequality in a panel of urban areas from 1970 to 2000. I too found that the depressing effect of large establishments on aggregate levels of inequality ceased by 1990.\u00a0 As noteworthy, average establishment size (as a measure of \u201cdownsizing\u201d) declined in the 1980s but by just a small amount. It then increased (also by a small amount) in the 1990s. Similar evidence is provided by Baumol, Blinder, and Wolff . \n Thus the decline of the large firm, at least by these definitions, is less consequential than the decline of what the large firm once stood for in terms of equity norms enforced by struggle (i.e., unions) and reinforced by a lack of competition. (And here I agree with Shamus Kahn that changes in constraints are likely more important than changes in norms.) \n But you could argue that what we are really after are the practices of such firms, rather than their size or size distribution per se (though Jesper Sorensen and Olav Sorenson provide an elegant and persuasive theory of how the number and diversity of firms affects wage inequality). This is where Davis\u2019 path breaking research is so crucial, and the published paper by Davis and Cobb fills in many of the blanks between Davis\u2019s prior work on changes in corporate structure and rising economic inequality. \n The next step is to operationalize some of these changes in corporate governance in finer detail. Take mergers and acquisitions, for example. Ola Sjoberg has already shown that they are correlated with cross-national variation in earnings inequality, even relative to a number of more common explanations (e.g., globalization). As I said at the outset, so much has changed over this period that isolating exactly which changes matter the most, and when, is the biggest challenge. \n Finally, what I most look forward to reading from organizational sociologists are their ideas of how corporations can be reorganized to reduce market inequality. The prescriptive literature in economics, sociology, and political science speaks in near unison when it comes to the best and most viable solution to rising inequality in the U.S.: progressive taxes. The market is impossible to tame. \n But my forthcoming book on public opinion about income inequality shows that Americans concerned about income inequality (and, yes, they are concerned) want less market inequality and more market opportunity. And they don\u2019t necessarily see taxes as achieving either of those goals. There is a huge vacuum in public discourse, in other words, around the question of what the market institutions of the future can and should look like. Many are working on this question, but their collective voice is weak, and new and creative ideas are still desperately needed."], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/the-corporation-and-inequality/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/": 4, "https://mgmt.upenn.edu/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://asr.sagepub.com/": 3, "http://www.northwestern.edu/": 3, "http://yalepress.yale.edu/": 1, "http://books.simonandschuster.com/": 1, "http://www.virginia.edu/": 1, "http://esr.oxfordjournals.org/": 1, "https://www.russellsage.org/": 1, "http://www.worldinequality.net": 1}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}, {"content": ["Jesse Fagan, an orgtheory PhD student, asked that we publicize a pilot study that he\u2019s conducting.

My coauthor, Ed Carberry, and I think so. In a new paper that just came out in the Journal of Management Studies we show that firms began using stock option expensing, a practice that used to be seen as quite problematic and undesirable by executives and boards, after a series of scandals rocked the corporate world in the early 2000s, causing firms to look for new ways to restore their credibility. Stock option expensing became a tool that companies could use to distance themselves from the stigma associated with corporate scandal. Our analyses show that firms facing media scrutiny around claims of corporate fraud and firms that were targets of shareholder activism around corporate governance were much more likely adopt stock option expensing. Firms that faced both intense media scrutiny and shareholder activism were especially likely to adopt the practice. We argue that in the period directly following the Enron scandal stock option expensing became seen as an impression management tactic that firms could use to restore confidence in their accountability to the public. \n The title of the paper is \u201cDefensive Practice Adoption in the Face of Organizational Stigma: Impression Management and the Diffusion of Stock Option Expensing.\u201d You can download the paper on my website.

We argue that understanding defensive adoption requires attending to both the dynamics of organizational stigma and impression management, and test our theoretical claims by\u00a0 analysing the diffusion of an accounting practice, stock option expensing (SOPEX), following the Enron scandal. We first provide evidence that the media and shareholder activists transformed the practice into a\u00a0 defensive device by theorizing it as a solution to problems relating to corporate fraud and corporate governance. Using event history analysis, we then show that corporations that became targets of stigma- inducing threats were more likely to adopt SOPEX and that the media were a key force channeling these threats."], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/defensive-practice-adoption-and-organizational-stigma/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/": 1, "http://www.google.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}, {"content": ["This Fall\u2019s book forum is about Andreas Glaeser\u2019s Political Epistemics, a historical ethnography of East German socialism. This week\u2019s installment will focus on the theoretical purpose of the book, which is to articulate and defend \u201cthe sociology of understanding.\u201d \n What is this \u201csociology of understanding?\u201d Well, it draws on a number of ideas that should be familiar to cultural sociologists. First, it\u2019s fairly Schutz/Berger and Luckmann in nature. There is a \u201clifeworld\u201d built upon a common stock of knowledge. \u201cWe all know that this is true.\u201d Second, it\u2019s also interactional. In Glaeser\u2019s model, people develop their understanding of the world through affirmation/negation from other people or institutions. \n So far, I think the picture is well rooted in cultural sociology. What Glaeser adds is an argument about the institutionalization of the self. Rather than assume that people have fairly independent interests and beliefs about the world, he argues that selves are built from of affirmation and negation from the social environment. Now, Glaeser isn\u2019t making a Foucault style argument about how we lose ourselves in a network of signifiers. Quite the contrary, he\u2019s arguing about the rootedness of one\u2019s understanding of the world. Historical events affirm one\u2019s understanding of the world, while others disrupt that notion of self. \n How does this sociology of understanding (SoU) help us to do political sociology, such as analyzing the dissolution of communism? Well, if you believe SoU, the locus of attention should be on understanding how people construct their world in both abstract terms and in daily life. Abstract theories, like Marxism-Leninism, provide a basic vocabulary for people to assess their world and produce collective action. At the same time SoU theory suggests that these understandings can only sustain a type of self when reinforced by exogenous events and institutional life. A lot of daily political life is a response to the juxtaposition of these worldviews and observation, with actors often scrambling to make sense of events that would be unsurprising to others. \n The SoU theory has interesting implications. For example, SoU theory implies that Western arguments about freedom would me moot points. The ideals of individual liberty only resonates in nations with specific institutional arrangements. Instead, people in socialist nations would criticize the system from within. And there is much truth to this observation. Dissidents and reforms rarely waved their copy of Road to Serfdom in the air. Rather, they often relied on arguments articulated by dissident socialist intellectuals. Thus, the collapse of communism, in this view, is less about external pressures and more about the management or mismanagement of contradictions. \n The result of SoU theory is that one should understand how historical events, ideologies, organizational behavior, and personal biography intertwine to create the political system. Social changes happens when these factors shift, not so much when outsiders, like Reagan or Kennedy, stand by a wall and proclaim freedom.

Solo sociology programs, like Chicago, were in the distinct minority. \n Most sociology programs were part of economics programs until the 1920s. \n There was still much collaboration between sociology and economics until the 1940s. \n Once economic institutionalism finally faded, ties between disciplines faded. \n The separation really started when sociologists started their separate meetings. \n \n What to make of this history? A few thoughts: 1. Heterodox economists should just give up on mainstream economists and hang out with sociologists. 2. There was some sort of hybrid disciplinary action going on that got truncated in the 1940s. It probably happened on both sides. Mathematical formalism made strides in economics, while structuralism appeared in sociology at the same time. These formalizations probably created needless rifts between disciplines.

Isabel Fernandez-Mateo of London Business School wrote the post, and Philip Cohen of the University of Maryland and the Family Inequality blog provided commentary. \n Isabel Fernandez-Mateo \n Thank you Brayden, Bruce and Jerry for inviting me to participate in this conversation on inequality \u2013 a topic which I care deeply about. I would like to post a few thoughts about a type of inequality that I think a lot of other people are also concerned with: the scarcity of women in top jobs. The problem is clear, and the list of potential solutions is long \u2013 quotas, changes in firms\u2019 performance evaluation systems, family friendly policies, etc. One could thus easily assume that by now we have a very good understanding of why the problem exists in the first place (i.e. how and why we lose women as we go up the hierarchy). I believe, however, that we are not even close. For starters, we may be looking in the wrong places. \n For decades, our knowledge of careers and inequality has been closely linked to the study of internal labor markets: how firms allocate people to jobs. As a result, our explanations for why so few women get placed in top positions have mostly focused on the role of organizational practices, which create barriers for women in internal promotion. Roberto Fernandez makes this point in a couple of recent papers , where he reminds us that the metaphor of the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d is alive and well. \n And yet we have some pretty good evidence that the traditional career model, in which the best route up is to be promoted within a single firm, is losing its dominance. A number of authors have argued that relationships between firms and employees have become much more arm\u2019s-length. This means that career advancement is now more influenced by external rather than internal labor markets. If so, getting hired into the right jobs in the right companies is becoming more important than climbing the ladder inside the firm (see Matthew Bidwell\u2019s paper for an interesting twist on this). This has major consequences for how we think about inequality. Still, much of our research on women\u2019s lack of access to the top remains embedded in the imagery of the internal labor market, where promotions \u2013 rather than external hiring processes \u2013 are the main focus. I of course do not mean to discard the importance of the former, but I think that it is time we pay much more attention to the latter. \n Over the past few years I have been investigating the mechanisms that may sustain gender inequality outside the firm, particularly in the context of contract employment. I have found evidence that the way women move across jobs in different firms matters for how well they do over time. Since every move involves a hiring process, in a recent paper I investigated how hiring processes contribute to sort women into lower paid jobs in the IT sector. Here the role of screeners external to the firm (i.e. staffing firms) was crucial. It was their actions \u2013 not those of female applicants or employers \u2013 that contributed most to keeping women out of higher paid temporary jobs. Could this kind of mechanism also explain why so few women get hired into top management positions? \n My next goal is precisely to examine whether it is the gatekeepers who place men and women in top jobs differently. It doesn\u2019t take much to realize that executive search firms are the place to look. Nowadays hardly anyone gets hired in a top position without the involvement of these organizations; yet they remain a black box for researchers. When observing how few women get placed at the top, it is easy to jump to the conclusion that search firms must be contributing to make it so ( old boys\u2019 clubs, stereotyping, you name it ). This may well be true, but we simply do not know. We are only seeing the outcome of their actions (who they place) but not the process (how they choose from the candidate pool). The only way to truly understand why women do not get into these jobs is to track them from the very beginning of the hiring pipeline, starting with the long list of candidates that are initially considered, and following them each step of the way (including whose decisions \u2013 search firm, candidates or clients \u2013 are more important at each step). This is precisely what Roberto Fernandez and I are doing in a new project, where we have got hold of full pipeline data from a big UK executive search firm. By following our favourite route of dissecting social mechanisms, we hope to provide some clear (and possibly unexpected) answers to the question of why there are still so few women at the top. Keep posted! \n Commentary by Philip Cohen \n David Brooks recently , breezily (of course) attributed the \u201ctippy-top\u201d glass ceiling to the supply side: \u201cMen still dominate the tippy-top of the corporate ladder because many women take time off to raise children.\u201d If you were going to choose a single variable to over-emphasize, motherhood is not a bad choice , but of course that\u2019s not a simple matter of women\u2019s choice. \n The motherhood focus is consistent with the results from applicant-pool analysis that show women absent from hiring pipelines. And I appreciate the focus by Isabel and her colleagues on hiring processes, with creative empirical analysis of applicant pools. All of us who study earnings and occupations among people who already have jobs need to be aware of this work. \n Focusing on the supply side, of course, raises the ire of anti-victim-blamers . That\u2019s unfortunate, because if you back up from the analysis \u2013 look wider than the single-firm studies \u2013 the supply side reflects the cumulative effects of many individual and collective actors. Families, the education system, and upstream labor-market actors are the most prominent. The supply-side analysis only rankles if you constrict your view with a methodological-individualist lens and see the supply-side as synonymous with individual choice. (You can tell I just taught Durable Inequality .) \n To the extent that careers are increasingly spread across multiple firms, this point is of growing salience not just because of the larger role for external versus internal hiring processes, but because every job change is a point of leverage for all these other actors as well. Previous employers\u2019 practices provoke job changes in the first place (after all, there is discrimination in firing , too), as do the career moves of spouses . How to handle such changes is not simply an individual victim\u2019s personal choice for which to be blamed. \n We especially need to consider the role of state policy in shaping family-career interactions over the life course. When adequate family leave is not available, when health care is too expensive , when high-quality preschool education is inaccessible or too expensive , when the state-sanctioned workday is too damn long \u2013 all that increases the pressure that women\u2019s family obligations place on their career trajectories. \n Rather than seeing such influences as competing for importance with hiring and promotion processes, and arguing over where researchers\u2019 attentions should focus, we need to consider how state, family and market dynamics interact with hiring and promotion. Workers make job-search choices under understands and assumptions about firm preferences and practices, and employers (or headhunters) see \u2013 or assume \u2013 the effects of wide contextual forces on the workers they might hire.

Perhaps the best-known debate on this topic is the one associated with Russell Jacoby\u2019s 1987 book,\u00a0 The Last Intellectuals , which famously lamented the disappearance of \u201cpublic intellectuals\u201d from American life. In the years since its publication, Jacoby\u2019s book and the idea of the \u201cpublic intellectual\u201d have earned enormous attention from journalists, pundits, and scholars. \n However, reading over some of the major entries in this debate, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that the \u201cpublic intellectual\u201d discussion has yielded more heat than light. In the first place, it\u2019s striking how much disagreement still attends the central question a quarter-century later: Is public intellectualism declining or thriving in America? It depends on who you ask. Three days ago, Henry Giroux\u2019s\u00a0 Counterpunch \u00a0essay \u201c The Disappearance of Public Intellectuals \u201d seemed to take the basic truth of Jacoby\u2019s thesis for granted. Meanwhile, many other writers have taken the opposite stance by arguing that public intellectuals are alive and well in the US. A good example is Daniel W. Drezner\u2019s 2008 paper \u201c Public Intellectuals 2.0 ,\u201d which maintained that \u201cthe growth of online publication venues has stimulated rather than retarded the quality and diversity of public intellectuals.\u201d \n A second glance at this debate reveals a likely reason for the disagreement. Put simply, there has never been any consensus about the proper definition of the term\u00a0 public intellectual . In fact, it\u2019s fair to say that how a given writer operationalizes the term tends to determine where he or she stands on the issue. \n \n Is there a way to contribute to this debate without unwittingly producing another round in the potentially endless cycle of laments and celebrations? I think there is, but only by drawing on certain insights from the sociology of intellectuals. In my book, I make use of a conceptual framework with a long pedigree in this area (particularly the work of Weber, Bourdieu, and Gil Eyal*) to relate the rise of think tank-affiliated policy experts to the debate on \u201cpublic intellectuals.\u201d The first contribution this framework offers is to clarify the discussion\u2019s conceptual substrate. In particular, it lets us see that the\u00a0 public intellectual \u00a0concept acquires its rhetorical force from two ideas already familiar to scholars of intellectuals. The first is\u00a0 cognitive autonomy , by which I mean an intellectual group\u2019s ability to enforce positive standards of rigor and competence on its members. \n Autonomy is easy to grasp in principle. For example, we could say that doctors enjoy a certain degree of autonomy from patients in their ability to evaluate their medical needs and determine the best course of treatment independently of the patients\u2019 opinions. Yet the operative phrase here is \u201ca certain degree.\u201d Once we think about real-life cases, it becomes clear that perfect autonomy is neither achievable nor desirable for an intellectual or professional group. The same doctors, for example, always face certain pressures to take into account the preferences of patients before deciding on a diagnosis or treatment. Furthermore\u2014and this is a crucial point\u2014how much pressure an expert group faces depends heavily on the presence or absence of rivals who are willing to tailor their services expressly to \u201cconsumer demand.\u201d Extending the medical example, we could say that the presence of holistic and New Age healers poses a potential threat to doctors, who can no longer count on being the \u201conly game in town\u201d in treating illness (that is, if they ever could). Doctors might try to co-opt the knowledge of their rivals\u2014witness mainstream medical exhortations about the value of meditation\u2014or they may challenge its legitimacy. But the key point is that a strategy of uncompromising autonomy leaves an expert group vulnerable to competition from less autonomous rivals. \n If membership in a highly autonomous group is vital to \u201cintellectualism,\u201d then what could make an intellectual \u201cpublic\u201d? Here the key notion is what Gil Eyal calls \u201copenness.\u201d Openness is the opposite of closure (in the Weberian sense), which refers to a group\u2019s ability to control the means of entry into its own ranks and exercise proprietary control over its knowledge through credentialing and training mechanisms. Closure also implies a certain degree of esotericism or \u201cmystery,\u201d as when a medical doctor uses an obscure term for an illness or a professor relies on arcane jargon to make an argument. Both acts sharpen the distinction between the doctor and the layperson. The concept\u00a0 public intellectual , on the other hand, suggests a certain willingness to \u201cgive away\u201d one\u2019s knowledge by speaking in a language that is accessible to an educated lay public. \n Once again, though, we can see why openness is no simple matter, and why it poses a second dilemma for intellectuals. Just as too much closure leads to pure esotericism (and potentially the loss of clients), too much openness leads to the loss of proprietary control over one\u2019s knowledge (and the material and symbolic rewards that come with it). Think, for example, of everyday folk wisdom, which is freely available to everyone and therefore \u201cowned\u201d by no one. \n The figure below (pasted from my book and adapted from Eyal) summarizes this framework by depicting the two oppositions I\u2019ve described as axes in a theoretical space of relations. Bourdieu\u2019s contribution to this discussion is to suggest that what Weber referred to as \u201cideal-types\u201d are better thought of as\u00a0 unstable corner locations \u00a0in a field of forces and relations. In other words, because the corners of the space are the most dangerous places for real-life intellectuals to exist, most of the \u201caction\u201d occurs closer to the center. As Bourdieu notes, once we\u2019ve used the ideal-types to specify the dimensions of the space and the forces brought to bear on those who enter it, we can discard the ideal-types altogether. Eyal\u2019s contributions are to clarify the dilemmas associated with the two axes and to emphasize the powerful allure of the field\u2019s \u00a0center . An expert group that wants to keep its consumers, he says, must strike tactical\u00a0 balances \u00a0between autonomy and heteronomy and openness and closure. \n  \n From\u00a0 Think Tanks in America , p. 86 \n The model sketched here suggests why endless confusion over the status of \u201cpublic intellectuals\u201d is not surprising\u2014and why writings on the topic often devolve into futile battles over the \u201ctrue\u201d meaning of the term. In the first place, there are no natural boundaries within this space, only degrees of autonomy and openness. Furthermore, real social agents and groups always have an interest in demarcating the boundary of categories like\u00a0 public intellectual \u00a0in particular ways. When Russell Jacoby writes, for example, that public intellectualism is in decline because of the \u201cprofessionalization and academization\u201d of scholars, it\u2019s hard to read this as merely a neutral description of the world. It is also part of an attempt to decry one kind of academic career path in relation to another. \n In my book, I use this model to describe the strategic repertoires of think tank-affiliated \u201cpolicy experts,\u201d which tend to draw them toward the field\u2019s center. At one point, I focus on the case of AEI fellow\u00a0 Charles Murray \u00a0( Losing Ground ,\u00a0 The Bell Curve ). Murray\u2019s successful intervention in the 1980s-90s welfare debate depended not on his ability to represent a specific intellectual \u201ctype,\u201d but on his ability to exist\u00a0 in between \u00a0types by merging disparate skills and styles strategically. Murray entered the debate in the early 1980s with all the outward appearances of a \u201cpublic intellectual,\u201d or someone who could challenge the political orthodoxy of the day from a standpoint of relative autonomy while speaking in terms that were accessible to the lay public. But he also gained a degree of authority from the appearance of technical proficiency that came from his experience as a former government analyst. Once Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, however, Murray repositioned himself as a crusader and spokesman for the anti-welfare movement by testifying before Congress and serving on an official White House commission convened to move the legislation forward. There is even a hint of \u201civory tower\u201d scholasticism in Murray\u2019s story. (As he told me in an interview, \u201cIn the think tank world . . . I have\u2014and this is not really an exaggeration\u2014I have essentially spent the last 21 years doing exactly as I pleased, every day and all day.\u201d) \n  \n Public intellectual?: AEI fellow Charles Murray, described as both an \u201cexemplary social scientist\u201d by Christopher DeMuth (in his Irving Kristol Award presentation) and a \u201cconservative evildoer\u201d and producer of \u201cracist pseudo-science\u201d by Eric Alterman (in What Liberal Media? ) \n The key point is that the field\u2019s center is the best position from which to fend off challenges from rivals and maintain a stable clientele. \n To move the public intellectualism debate forward, I think we should resist the impulse to treat the agent as the privileged unit of analysis. A public intellectual is not a flesh-and-blood person, nor even an ideal-type. Instead, the term is better understood as referring to an unstable corner location in a space of relations. A better approach, then, is to trace the relationships among real intellectual and professional groups within this space historically. In my next post, I\u2019ll proceed with this task in more detail.

The issue is that libertarians often hype other issues, like taxes, more than civil rights. Not too much discussion about discrimination, Jim Crow, and so forth. A blogger from the pro-immigration website Open Borders asked how often \u00a0libertarians argued against, for example, segregation. \n I think the commenters (myself included) got it right when we said \u201csome, but not much.\u201d In other words, from time to time, libertarian intellectuals did talk about the evils of segregation. \u00a0Usually, the issue is couched in terms of the use of state power to prohibit blacks from holding property and practicing certain occupations, like the law. Sometimes it was a commentary on what was good and bad in the Black freedom movement. There is the occasional talk of opposing colonialism. But overall, it was not an overwhelming response. \n The relatively weak answer to Black oppression is puzzling. Opposing Jim Crow was a no brainer from the libertarian point of view. Blacks had been slaves, which is the antithesis of personal freedom. Then, after Reconstruction, they had been subjected to humiliating and painful legal regulations in addition to extensive personal violence. While libertarians may disagree with liberals about the remedy for state violence and segregation, you would think that they would have been marching arm and arm with liberals in the 1960s. \n But that didn\u2019t happen. Black repression takes a back burner on the libertarian shopping list. But why? I think it has to do with the sociology of elite libertarians. Roughly speaking, the people who defined the libertarian agenda in the mid to late 20th century were defined by two social processes. First, nearly all of the major libertarian intellectuals belonged to the Jewish diaspora in America. Some were refugees from East European communism, like Ayn Rand. The Austrian school of economics was lead by central European Jews like Mises and the second generation was led by New Yorker Murray Rothbard. Second generation Jews were also very prominent, like Milton Friedman and Robert Nozick, whose father, according to wiki, was from a Russian shtetl. While these writers did occasionally address Black issues, American civil rights probably did not loom in their minds as much fascism and socialism in Europe. \n Second, many, if \u00a0not most, of the leading libertarian intellectuals were strongly rooted in American and Western European academia. Specifically, they were mainly in the fields of economics and philosophy. Therefore, they were subjected to very specific professional pressures. When these intellectuals were active, economics transformed itself from a historical field into a form of highly mathematical social engineering. Academic philosophy also underwent a profound transformation. That discipline downplayed the ideas now known as \u201ccontinental philosophy,\u201d (e.g., Husserl or Heidegger) and refocused on \u201canalytic philosophy,\u201d which is noted for its extreme emphasis on developing clear concepts and employing ideas from linguistics, mathematics and symbolic logic. \n Thus, the social field of libertarian intellectuals is one that combines ideas derived from thinking about the European experience with the consciousness embodied by symbolic and highly mathematical academic disciplines. This isn\u2019t to say that all of the major libertarian intellectuals accepted or praised this state of affairs. Austrian economists are noted for their rejection of mathematics in economic analysis, but they were still embedded in an economics discipline that favored certain types of intellectual problems. They were still subjected to some strong professional pressures.\u00a0The end result is that the libertarian social field permits discussion of race issues, but it\u2019s not a topic that wins the competition for attention. \n Now, it didn\u2019t have to be that way. Imagine if some group of Black intellectuals had set out to systematically develop an anti-statist political philosophy, much as Third World intellectuals developed indigenous versions of Marxism, like liberation theology. For example, what if DuBois had an evil twin brother who looked at the post-Reconstruction South and developed a theory of the state as an illegitimate racial coalition? Or, imagine, if some people in the Harlem Renaissance had taken a sort of proto-Tyler Cowen position about how capitalism allows black cultural forms to flourish? \n If that had happened, then the libertarian social field would be different and there\u2019d probably be a much more serious engagement with race. There would have a been stronger role in defining anti-segregation arguments in the civil rights era, a stronger resistance to a coalition with Whites who use libertarian rhetoric to justify intolerance, and a serious acceptance that racism is an ingrained feature of human life that needs to be identified, refuted, and transformed. \n Adverts:\u00a0 From Black Power / Grad Skool Rulz"], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/race-and-the-sociology-of-elite-libertarian-intellectuals/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.smashwords.com/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 1, "http://econlog.econlib.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}, {"content": ["This post is the first part of a blog forum about inequality and organizational theory. Bruce Kogut and Jerry Kim of Columbia University wrote the post, and Shamus Khan , also of Columbia, wrote the commentary. \n Bruce Kogut and Jerry Kim \n Why should we care about income inequality?\u00a0 For many, an egalitarian society is a just society .\u00a0 The argument for this belief ranges from\u00a0 \u201cI just think that\u201d to sophisticated reasoning about declining marginal utilities and the distribution of natural abilities and the tradeoffs between efficiency and equity.\u00a0 And for those troubled by such tradeoffs, this latter reasoning boils to the hoped-for compromise that \u2018we can get a lot more equity at very little sacrifice in efficiency\u2019.\u00a0 Arguing about that claim, economics has spilled a lot of the proverbial ink. \n But why should we in management and organizational theory care about income inequality in the context of what we study and teach?\u00a0\u00a0 The short answer is that the primary source for the massive growth in inequality in the US is due to the greater share going to those who are the top managers of public and private firms.\u00a0 The share of total income in the US earned by the top 1 percent of income earners has gone from 9 percent in 1970 to 23.5 percent in 2007.\u00a0 \u00a0While an increase in inequality is to be found in many rich countries, the US distribution is remarkably more skewed. \n If we take a closer look at this 1% (which was approximately for incomes greater than $400,000 in 2007), a substantial number of high-income earners are managers. In fact, according to a recent analysis of individual tax return data, close to half of the top 0.1%\u2014those that make upwards of $2 million\u2014can be categorized as non-finance executives, supervisors or managers. \u00a0\u00a0What is it about business organizations today that are distributing such wealth to their top managers? \n An answer to this story must be consistent with an important stylized fact: the share of remuneration of top managers has increased much faster than the market value of firms. One common argument is that technological change and globalization have led to increasing returns to general managerial talent. We call this \u2018the best athlete\u2019 argument.\u00a0 \u00a0However, the historical evidence suggests that such change predates this recent turbo-charging of pay. \n Moreover, if an increased demand for scarce managerial talent drives salaries, then we should see a persisting inequality of pay among top executives. \u00a0After all, given all the pay for performance, shouldn\u2019t executive pay be more unequal than the pay in the general population? Salaries in Major League Baseball (MLB)\u2014a context that is perhaps closest to a perfect market for talent\u2014exhibit a level of inequality that is slightly higher than what we find in the overall population, but more importantly, consistent over time.\u00a0 The inequality for executive compensation, on the other hand, fluctuates a great deal, peaking at more than 15% in 2000 above of the inequality found in \nbaseball and then falling by 2009 about 15% below. \n The alternative explanation that we offer in this working paper is that social norms have shifted in the past two decades. The internet boom was an exogenous shock: high stock prices and the adoption of pay for performance knocked some salaries into the stratosphere.\u00a0 Social comparisons by benchmarking kicked in and inequality fell, BUT now the proportional share of executive compensation to firm market value went dramatically up. \n Executives are surely often very hard working and markets tend to reward that.\u00a0 However, there is also ambiguity that permits gaming of the system. A strike out or a single is pretty unambiguous and the market for players seems to sort into a fairly stable pay distribution.\u00a0 This is not the case for executives whose performance is harder to observe.\u00a0 You would think that boards would do their best to get rid of all the noise they can, such as stock market fluctuations.\u00a0 But a good deal of research says this is not the case. \n That directors of boards do not try harder to purge noise suggests that the rent-seeking theory of pay can explain this explosion. \u00a0However, managerial rent seeking to rise up the income rank seem to have been around much earlier than the start of this historical trend.\u00a0 And similarly, the argument that the growth in pay is due to technical progress that drives up the value of executive talent also does not explain the pattern, for technical progress has been around for some time in any event.\u00a0 But the real problem with this argument is that it just not particularly clear why technical progress should cause executive pay to skyrocket in absolute terms relative to skilled labor in general. \n At all levels of society, social comparisons are bound to be made and to provide footholds into gauging self worth.\u00a0 It\u2019s not compelling that these comparisons need to require such historically astounding degrees of inequality as justified by stories of sudden technical change driving the demand for executive talent \u2013for which there is little evidence. \u00a0\u00a0And, to depart from data, one suspects that such stunning inequities have unpleasant cultural and democratic consequences that are bound to be reflected in the attitudes and behaviors of the business leaders of our age. \n Organization theorists and economic sociologists are well positioned to join other social sciences in the study of the role that social norms and peer benchmarking as well as gender and racial bias play in generating inequality.\u00a0 This is a global issue that nevertheless begins in the decisions made by business organizations.\u00a0\u00a0 That the topic of economic inequality is also entwined in the great political and normative debates of social justice makes our collective contribution all the more desirable. \n Discussion by\u00a0Shamus Khan \n Bruce and Jerry\u2019s piece is a wonderful primer on elites and inequality. My response is simply a chronicle of my thoughts upon reading it (and their paper, which I would strongly recommend to all). \n First, I think we need to establish why we should care about inequality, particularly if it is driven by wage growth of elites rather than a lowering of the floor of wages for the poorest. Christopher Jencks has done some work arguing that greater inequality is either neutral or bad for societies (but never good) , and I\u2019m a little more convinced by it than I am recent work by Wilkinson and Pickett , which makes the same basic argument. But the Jencks and Wilkinson and Pickett arguments are hardly definitive, and it strikes me that some of the best reasons for caring about inequality are because of the relationships between inequality and mobility. Alan Krueger has argued that there is a \u201cGatsby Curve\u201d ( slides here ), drawing upon the work of Miles Corak . This has come under some criticism , but I think Corak\u2019s counter-arguments are quite convincing here: there is a tie between rising inequality and declining mobility. \n While the rhetoric of the \u201c1%\u201d has recently led to an important social awakening of the findings of a 2003 study by Piketty and Saez , Kogut and Kim somewhat quietly point to an important corrective: there\u2019s a lot of variation within this category, and perhaps we should be looking at the top 10% within it. From that Piketty and Saez and paper I would particularly point readers to Figure IV, which gets a little less attention than I think it should. One of the things it shows is that in earlier eras (1929), the very wealthy were fundamentally different from others within the rich, insofar as their income stream was from a different source (capital income rather than wage income). A quick way to think of this is that this is a Marxian condition \u2013 the super-rich were owners of capital like factories. Today it\u2019s still the case that the very rich are more likely to have capital income than the somewhat rich. But the story is not nearly as dramatic. (Importantly, these data don\u2019t include capital gains). And so today\u2019s rich are more \u201cWeberian\u201d \u2013 their position is not as tied to capital ownership but instead tied to wage wealth (money). I point to this because Kogut and Kim argue about the importance of shifting norms, and this might help explain why such shifts have happened. That is, wages have embedded within them the idea of pay-for-performance. So if your wages are high you must be really smart and really hard working and provide lots of value, otherwise you could simply be replaced at a lower wage rate. Such arguments work better with wage income than with capital income. \n The working paper by Kim, Kogut, and Yang provides a welcome evaluation for DiPrete, Eirich, and Pittinsky\u2019s \u201cleapfrog\u201d argument (particularly, why the leapfrogging happens when it does and not in other times \u2013 why pay is similar among CEOs in the 2000s rather than an arms race). This argument differs from Olivier Godechot\u2019s work, which makes an argument for managers \u201cholding up\u201d their firms insofar as they have control over assets and can thereby punish firms that do not comply with their salary and bonus demands. For Godechot, this is particularly unique to finance, where such assets are easily transferable to other firms. \n For Kogut and Kim, an exogenous shock of the internet boom created inappropriately \u201cstratospheric\u201d salaries for some, which others started to benchmark themselves against this. This brings up some interesting implications. The first is that the financialization of the economy that has been the focus of so many might be a red herring. While Godechot\u2019s argument is conditional upon finance (or a market sector with easily transferable assets), the mechanism that Kogut and Kim offer does not require the rise of finance. What do you need? Interconnected networks of CEOs wherein a subgroup suddenly is considerably overpaid \u2013 high pay diffuses through social networks. What matters is the network structure, not the structure of the economy. \n Yet most readers will wonder: such exogenous shocks are not uncommon within markets, and so why did the diffusion happen now and not before (and not globally \u2013 the US was not the only nation to experience a dot-com boom)? There is a hint of an answer; pointing to McCall and Percheski and Western and Rosenfeld (unions), they suggest that organizations that might have constrained this process or sanctioned those engaging in it have been weakened or disappeared. This makes me wonder if we\u2019re really talking about new norms (which I\u2019m defining as expectations for action). Instead, what if the norms are somewhat constant and the constraints are what vary? This is important because if the norms vary we can argue about returning to the era of a \u201csocially responsible CEO\u201d but if they are constant, this kind of discussion doesn\u2019t make sense and instead we ask ourselves about how to construct constraining institutions. \n Finally, I\u2019d point to the importance of inter-elite contention: something often ignored when thinking about constraints upon elites. And this returns us to the finance point. When constraining elites we often think in Marxian terms (even if we\u2019re not Marxists). That means we think of elites as having fairly consistent (or shared) interests, and that to constrain elites, masses must act. But it may well be the case that inter-elite contention is far more effective than any other mechanism for constraining elites \u2013 by creating collective action problems and competing interests. Here, then, shifts in markets where certain sectors become increasingly dominant will have large negative effects. And as such, the massive transfer of wealth to the finance sector \u2013 perhaps around the order of more than 6 trillion dollars since 1980 \u2013 has created conditions wherein within-elite constraints have declined."], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/08/income-inequality-and-the-management-of-organizations/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://papers.ssrn.com/": 2, "http://web.williams.edu/": 1, "http://asr.sagepub.com/": 2, "http://milescorak.wordpress.com/": 2, "http://olivier.free.fr/": 1, "http://milescorak.com/": 2, "http://www4.columbia.edu/": 2, "http://www.brookings.edu/": 1, "http://www.amacad.org/": 1, "http://www.aeaweb.org/": 1, "http://sociology.columbia.edu/": 1, "http://www.justiceharvard.org/": 1, "http://www.annualreviews.org/": 2, "http://web.mit.edu/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 2, "http://www.jstor.org/": 2, "http://elsa.berkeley.edu/": 1, "http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}, {"content": ["A couple of months ago, Bruce Kogut approached me with an idea to do a blog forum discussing inequality and organizational theory.

The main points of that conversation, which originated with Kieran Healy\u2019s August 22 post and continued more recently in Fabio\u2019s posts ( here and here ) were that: (1) the category \u201ctheorist\u201d seems to be disappearing as an occupational position in American sociology, and that (2) fewer sociologists identify themselves as theorists. \n There\u2019s no denying the basic fact underpinning the first point: namely, that the number of jobs with the label \u201ctheorist\u201d attached to them has gone down in American sociology over the last few decades. Kieran posits that one result of this trend is growing semantic confusion over the meaning of the term theory : \n As a consequence, many people are not sure what, from a disciplinary point of view, theory in sociology is supposed to be any more, or how it should be done, or what if anything distinguishes it from intellectual history, or philosophy, or normative political theory, or humanities-style \u2018Theory,\u2019 or mathematical modeling. \n I agree\u2014this is probably true. However, it\u2019s worth pointing out that semantic confusion is neither a necessary nor a ubiquitous feature of the shift being discussed. Furthermore, when we start to think about what it means to \u201cdo theory,\u201d the discussion takes on a different cast and the issue of \u201ctheory\u2019s\u201d status as an occupational position becomes secondary. \n I\u2019d begin by noting a seeming exception to proposition #2 above: namely, the recent growth of a vibrant network of young sociologists who identify themselves explicitly as \u201ctheorists\u201d\u2014best signaled by the popularity of the ASA Theory section\u2019s Junior Theorist Symposium. Started in 2005 by Neil Gross and Mich\u00e8le Lamont and resumed in 2008 after a two-year hiatus, the event has grown steadily over the past few years. The list of past \u201csenior theorist\u201d discussants includes Andrew Abbott, Jeffrey Alexander, Craig Calhoun, Randall Collins, Phil Gorski, Richard Swedberg, Ann Swidler, Lo\u00efc Wacquant, Andreas Wimmer, and Viviana Zelizer.\u2020 \n Of course, the popularity of the JTS doesn\u2019t contradict the fact that there are fewer jobs for \u201ctheory\u201d specialists. But it does raise another question already anticipated in Kieran\u2019s post: Who are these people, and what do they mean by \u201ctheory\u201d? On this general topic, Kieran writes that, \u201cCrudely, the sort of people who once would have thought of themselves. . . primarily\u00a0as theorists now think of themselves as sociologists of culture instead, or (less often) as disciplinary historians of ideas.\u201d Is this true? Certainly there\u2019s a lot of overlap among these areas\u2014theory, culture, and the history of ideas\u2014in terms of ideas and personnel. Nevertheless, I think there remains, both in the JTS events and in other work done under the banner of \u201ctheory\u201d today, a coherent mission that\u2019s not reducible to the sociology of culture per se, or to the history of ideas. It\u2019s also something that can\u2019t be expressed in terms of an opposition between \u201ctheoretical\u201d and \u201cempirical\u201d work. I\u2019m referring to the\u00a0specific focus on the task of analytic construction, including the work of formulating rigorous concepts, historicizing the categories of one\u2019s research (not for its own sake, but as an ongoing feature of their implementation), and taking into account their social effects. And I\u2019d submit that the level of appreciation for these things in American sociology is more important than the specific fate of \u201ctheory\u201d as a subdiscipline. \n I can clarify this point by returning to the topic I\u2019ve been discussing on this blog: think tanks. Doubtless the two most common questions I get about my research in this area are: (1) \u201cWhich think tanks did you study?\u201d and (2) \u201cWould you consider [ organization X ] a think tank?\u201d These are both perfectly good questions, and they have something important in common: they\u2019re both fundamentally about category boundaries. The first question is essentially, \u201cWhat is the boundary of your study?\u201d, and the second is, \u201cWhat is the boundary of the think tank category?\u201d The only thing I don\u2019t like about these questions is that there\u2019s no easy 30-second \u201celevator version\u201d answer to either of them. That\u2019s because one of the contributions of my study, as I see it, is precisely to build a rigorous analytic concept of a think tank that lays bare some of the hidden features of the reigning political folk concept . \n I say \u2018build a rigorous concept,\u2019 but I don\u2019t mean build from scratch. In my case, this has meant applying and extending existing sociological concepts like network and field . And while space limitations prevent me from going into detail here, the conception of a think tank that I develop in the book is decidedly \u201cpractice-oriented\u201d (to use a fashionable phrase): To be a think tank, I say, is to become ensnared in a never-ending game of separation and attachment vis-\u00e0-vis the more established institutions of academia, politics, business, and the media. Think tanks must constantly signal their \u201cindependence\u201d from these institutions, on which they depend for resources, personnel, and legitimacy, even as they use their\u00a0 associations \u00a0with each one to mark their putative separation from the other institutions. It\u2019s from this idea that I develop a description of \u201cpolicy research\u201d as a hybrid practice of generating policy prescriptions while competing with other think tanks for donations, press coverage, and political attention. \n Why the need to be so \u201ctheoretical\u201d? At one level, it allowed me to ask certain important but neglected questions about think tanks. By separating the analytic concept from the political folk concept, I could treat the latter\u2019s growing use in American public and political life as something that needed to be explained. And because some of the organizations now included in the folk category predate the think tank classification by more than 60 years, the process I\u2019m referring to isn\u2019t reducible to a simple story of organizational creation. Instead, it was a complex process of network formation. The term think tank became meaningful only when a formerly disparate array of organizations became oriented to one another in their judgments and practices, and only when the members of this network developed novel intellectual products to separate themselves from more established institutions. \n So being \u201ctheoretical\u201d allowed me to focus on the social relations underpinning the emergence of think tanks. At another level, it allowed me to avoid what I saw as the main pitfall in the study of think tanks: the danger of inadvertently becoming harnessed to the interests of think tanks and their affiliated \u201cpolicy experts.\u201d As I say in the book, \u201corphaning the think tank for operational purposes subtly harnesses the scholar to its mission because the think tank\u2019s first goal, even prior to that of exercising political influence, is to differentiate itself from its nearest neighbors in social space.\u201d \n *** \n What\u2019s the connection between all this and the \u201cDude, where\u2019s my theory?\u201d discussion? Two summary points: \n (1) The status of sociological theory is different from its distinctiveness as an occupational position. \n I agree with the gist of the previous discussion as it appears in the posts I linked to above\u2014and there\u2019s nothing in it that contradicts this point. Nor would I deny the importance of the issue raised by Kieran and Fabio. Nevertheless, it seems to me that more relevant than whether or not \u201ctheorist\u201d is in decline as an occupational position are some other issues anticipated in Kieran\u2019s original post: inter alia, how strongly do American sociologists appreciate the importance of constructing rigorous analytic concepts? Do we reward those who take seriously the effects of classification systems, including the ones used by social scientists? Is it mandatory or merely optional to subject the conceptual dimension of your own work to relentless self-questioning? The presence or absence of people who specialize in these things might be indicators of theory\u2019s health or sickness. But insofar as we\u2019re all theorists, it\u2019s not a perfect one. \n (2) I \u2665 empirical data. \n The notion of \u201ctheory\u201d I\u2019m suggesting here (which is far from original) isn\u2019t built on an opposition between \u201ctheoretical\u201d and \u201cempirical\u201d work. In fact, in my own experience, being \u201ctheoretical\u201d has meant having to gather more data, not less. Or, to be blunt, I didn\u2019t spend two years in the swamp of Washington, DC visiting dozens of think tanks, interviewing their staff members, rooting through their archives, building a database of the educational and career backgrounds of over 1,000 think tank-affiliated policy experts, attending their public events, and even finagling my way into some of their private ones\u2014like some kind of low-rent Irwin M. Fletcher \u2014to be labeled \u201cnon-empirical\u201d (if that\u2019s what\u2019s implied in the term \u201ctheoretical\u201d). \n  \n The author (left, in disguise) gathering empirical data. \n Nevertheless, the theoretical component of my study, by which I mean the work of analytic construction, required its own effort. If nothing else, it should be clear by now that lurking behind questions like, \u201cWhich think tanks did you study?\u201d is a whole series of other questions for which commonsense answers aren\u2019t sufficient.\u2021 As I put it in the book, \u201cfor those involved in the world of policy research and advocacy, the practice of calling one\u2019s organization a \u2018think tank\u2019 is rarely a neutral act of self-description. It is also a strategic move in a social game, the rules of which we should try to understand\u2026. [T]o become a think tank is to rise above mere interest-group struggles and claim membership in the ranks of experts.\u201d\u00a7 \n __________________________________________ \n NOTES \n * My first and second posts can be found here and here , respectively. \n \u2020 My own connection to the JTS is as follows: I presented at the event in 2008; I co-organized it with Michal Pagis in 2011; and I attended all but one of the others. \n \u2021 It should also be clear why any answer I give to these questions might threaten to make my study look like some kind of exercise in \u201cdeconstruction.\u201d On the first question, consider my two best options. Option #1: \n Questioner :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which think tanks did you study? \n Me :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The book is partly a study of the think tank category itself, by which I mean its emergence in public and\u00a0political life, its changing boundary, and the historical conditions that made the classification possible. \n Questioner :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Come again? \n Me :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I mean that the focus is not so much on the members of a clearly defined organizational \u201cspecies\u201d or \u201ctype,\u201d but on the social forces and relations that made this blurry concept thinkable in the first place. Only after having examined this process historically could I identify specific org\u2026 \n Questioner :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ah\u2026 got it. Now go back to your Parisian caf\u00e9, Derrida. \n But I\u2019m no poststructuralist\u2014far from it\u2014and insofar as my aim was ever to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d anything, including the think tank concept, it was only as a prologue to reconstructing it analytically, with lots of empirical data. Which helps to explain why I\u2019ve become partial to option #2: \n Questioner :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Which think tanks did you study? \n Me :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All of them.\u2021* \n \u00a7 I fully grasp the key methodological question raised here: viz. If the think tank category is constitutively fuzzy and always in flux, as I say, then how does one decide which organizations to leave in or out of the study? This will/would have to be a topic for another post, but (very) briefly, the working solution in my case was to sample from various locations in the organizational network, including its center and periphery, and then to consider more broadly how this network was situated within bigger social structures. \n \u2021* Plus, as a precautionary measure, I carry around with me a copy of the Empirical Loyalty Oath, which quotes liberally from the Sedition Act of 1918 and reads, in part, \u201cI hereby declare that I am not now, nor have I ever been, a poststructuralist.\u201d"], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/dude-heres-my-social-theory/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/": 6, "http://www.imdb.com/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}, {"content": ["From Jest.com . \n Adverts:\u00a0 From Black Power / Grad Skool Rulz"], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/04/grad-skool-scam/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.smashwords.com/": 1, "http://www.jest.com/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}, {"content": ["This Fall\u2019s book forum will address Political Epistemics, a new book by Chicago sociologist Andreas Glaeser . The book investigates life in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It\u2019s an ambitious book that has three main aims. First, it\u2019s a political sociology argument. Glaeser argues that social change occurs when there is a break, or shift, in how people develop their identities and have them affirmed by various people and institutions. He calls this the \u201csociology of understandings.\u201d Second, Glaeser offers a historical account of two groups of people with very different understandings of East German socialism \u2013 Stasi officers and Berlin peace activists. Third, Glaeser claims that his sociology of understandings provides a better explanation of the dissolution of East German communism than other theories. \n As you might guess from this thumbnail sketch, the book is epic. It synthesizes a deep knowledge of Western cultural sociology with Glaeser\u2019s own reading of East European history and Communist ideology. There is also a lot of thick description, where Glaeser tracks down former Stasi officers, dissident intellectuals, and works through East German archives. Yet, the book hangs together remarkably well. Though Glaeser is erudite, the text is easy to follow and rich with interesting insights. It\u2019s a wonderful example of how a book can be very sophisticated, yet accessible to most readers. \n This book succeeds on a number of levels, though I do have some reservations, especially when Glaeser goes beyond his interview evidence and extrapolates to the broader issue of why Communism ended. We\u2019ll discuss these strong and weak points in the coming weeks, but for now, I\u2019ll end this introductory post with a discussion of why I chose this specific book. \n First, Political Epistemics has many sociological virtues. The topic \u2013 the fall of European Communism \u2013 is important and deserves serious attention. The transition away from Communism is a topic I wish that more graduate students would address. As late as the 1980s, much of the world\u2019s population lived under state socialism. Even today, we have a number of nations that have traditional Leninist/Maoist states (e.g., Cuba, North Korea), have leaders who are trying to push in that direction (e.g., Venezuela), hybrid state forms, such as modern China, or nationalist-socialist systems such as the Baath regimes of Hussein era Iraq, Kaddafi\u2019s Libya, and contemporary Syria. Another virtue is that the book is grounded in daily experience. Rather than rely on \u201cgrand history,\u201d Glaeser takes the time to uncover the meaning of these political systems by interviewing the people who made these systems a reality. \n Second, I chose this book for personal reasons \u2013 Glaeser was an instructor of mine in graduate school. The first time I met Glaeser was when he gave a job talk at the University of Chicago, where I was a young and very annoying graduate student. I was struck by his talk (a precis for Divided in Unity ) because it combined fancy schmancy hermeneutics and ethnography. Later, I took a course in cultural sociology with him. It didn\u2019t resemble any of the \u201cAmerican sociology\u201d courses. He yelled at us once \u2013 \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t know who de Certeau is? What do they teach you around here?\u201d* He also admitted that he doesn\u2019t watch cable TV. But still, he was always very generous when helping students get through the rather imposing corpus of European social theory. He even indulged me in a weird argument about whether the label \u201ccritical theory\u201d could be applied to rational choice theories.** So I was quite happy to see that his second book was out. When I read Political Epistemics, I recognize our culture theory syllabus embedded in it. It\u2019s always a pleasure to see how the ideas of the past form the books of the present. \n Next week: How to Understand the Sociology of Understanding \n Adverts:\u00a0 From Black Power / Grad Skool Rulz \n * Answer: Circa 1999, a lot of Park and Burgess, with a healthy dose of Simmel. And a lot of event history models. \n ** My view was that critical theory was not really an important theoretical distinction. Rather it\u2019s a normative term in disguise, or simply a term for second generation Marxist theory.\u00a0 I asked, \u201cFor example, couldn\u2019t, say, bounded rationality be critical theory in some sense if it lead to some level of reflexivity (as implied by Calhoun\u2019s definition of critical theory)?\u201d Hilarity ensued."], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/glaeser-book-forum-1-the-order-of-battle/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://www.smashwords.com/": 1, "http://sociology.uchicago.edu/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://books.google.com/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}, {"content": ["The art website Hyperallergic has a nifty new diagram illustrating the networks of artists responsible for abstract expressionism. \n Adverts:\u00a0 From Black Power / Grad Skool Rulz"], "link": "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/abstract-art-networks/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.smashwords.com/": 1, "http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://hyperallergic.com/": 1, "http://www.amazon.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "orgtheory.net"}]
