Empirical research into this condition has the potential to throw light on questions like how the brain processes music and why music listening can bring such pleasure to its listeners. However recent work has focused mainly on the perceptual abilities of people with C.A. and there has been little research into whether and how the observed perceptual deficits affect their appreciation of music in every day life. Assessing the degree with which amusics willingly engage with music in everyday life is a useful way of inferring how they feel about it and consequently evaluating the relationship between music perception and appreciation. We used hierarchical cluster analysis to evaluate the experience s ampling data collected from a total of 34 participants (17 amusics and 17 matched controls) and then observed how amusics were distributed over the resulting analysis solution. We found that at least 60 percent of amusics demonstrated a listening profile that was clearly distinct from that of controls. These amusics showed little evidence of wanting to engage with music in their everyday life. However the remaining amusics who fell into the cluster that mainly contained controls showed evidence of normal music appreciation; choosing to listen regularly and reporting obtaining pleasure from it. This research is important as it reveals contrasting attitudes towards music within the condition known as Congenital amusia. The reasons why appreciation may arise in the absence of normal perception are explored and further analysis is carried out to try to explain why the two groups of amusics show such different attitudes to music.   Research methods achievement predicted by stress, social class, and locus of control, but not dyscalculia  John Barry, City University (London) Negative attitudes towards learning research methods (RM) are associated with poor grades and dropout. The present cross-sectional internet survey explored preferences for learning RM and factors associated with RM grades. Psychology students ( N = 134) from high school to postgraduate level reported that more interaction with their teacher would improve grades. Those with most RM difficulty also wanted: practical work, visual teaching aids, more interesting textbooks, humour in teaching, smaller seminar groups, and more seminars. Using ordinal regression, the significant predictors of better RM grades relative to grades for other modules were: lower stress ( p < .001), more advantaged social background ( p < .005), and internal locus of control ( p < .013). The effect of motivation was mediated by stress. Dyscalculia was not associated with RM grade. These findings have implications for ways to improve the teaching of research methods to psychology students.   Multiple hypothesis testing when hypotheses are related logically using Shaffer\u2019s R test: A hierarchical step down procedure with a step up test at each step  Andrew Rutherford, Keele University Hochberg\u2019s (1988) presented a powerful test based on Simes\u2019 (1986) inequality. Rom (1990) later improved this test by defining and calculating exact p-values. Later, Hochberg and Rom (1995) described how to apply their tests when hypotheses were related logically, as described by Shaffer (1986). However, as Hochberg and Rom\u2019s (1995) account is not easily understood by sophisticated statistical mathematicians, it presents real problems for most other scientists. This may explain the lack of application of this important work. In response to my request for worked examples, Juliet Shaffer provided valuable insights into multiple hypothesis testing and Dror Rom delivered a new short-cut method to test logically related hypotheses, which he named Shaffer\u2019s R test. The background and application of Shaffer\u2019s R test will be described.   Exploring what is hidden: The power of Latent Class Analysis in uncovering barriers to engagement in the arts  Glenn A. Williams, Nottingham Trent University Latent class analysis is a powerful technique that enables researchers to glean insights into \u2018hidden\u2019 psychological experiences. It has been used in a variety of domains, such as with attempts: to understand psychosis as measured along a continuum of symptom expression; to identify features of computer games that are integral to the gaming experience; and to assess the characteristics of a range of trauma and suicidal behaviour typologies. The technique is grounded in the psychometric approach and item response theory and is a versatile method to dealing with nominal data in a deep and psychologically grounded way. This presentation will involve discussion of the key principles and practices when undertaking a latent class analysis. To illustrate the art and science of latent class analysis, a case example will draw on the nuances of data obtained from a general population survey of over 4,300 respondents and will model a set of various class solutions to unearth the barriers to engagement in the arts that could be present within a community.   Towards a rational use of mathematics in the psychology of reasoning Andy Fugard, University of Salzburg Logic is the mathematics of reasoning. Traditionally, logic in the psychology of reasoning was taken to mean classical logic and most non-mathematicians received a diagnosis of illogical. However, there are many logics, including probability logics. For so-called \"basic\" conditionals such as \"If the card shows a square, then it's red\", most people's degree of belief is given by a conditional probability, P(red|square), a justifiably rational interpretation. However, a significant minority treat an \"if\" as an \"and\" (conjunction), which is less easy to justify. Previously we found that, given a long series of trials, many of those initially showing a conjunction interpretation spontaneously shift to a conditional probability. In this talk I will present evidence that automatic stimulus-oriented processes are responsible for the conjunctions and inhibitory function is required for a shift. In another experiment we tested the effect of different expressions of identical (from the perspective of probability theory) conditionals, e.g., for conditionals concerning four cards numbered 1 to 4: \"If the card shows a 2, then it shows a 2 or a 4\" versus \"If the card shows a 2, then it shows an even number\". For the former type of conditional, most participants' degree of belief was 0, versus 1 for the latter type of conditional. A theory of relevant deduction, originally developed for classical logic, explains these two interpretations. These results illustrate the utility, and limitations, of logic for guiding theorizing and designing experiments about how non-mathematicians reason.  Adaptive design for model discrimination Maarten Speekenbrink, University College London Psychology is rich in formal models of learning, categorization and decision-making, to name but a few areas. While competing models differ in their substantive assumptions, they often make highly similar predictions. For this reason, model comparison based on empirical data is often inconclusive. Optimizing the design of an experiment for model discrimination is difficult, especially when individual participants differ widely in terms of model parameters. To resolve this problem, we present a method to design experiments adaptively whilst running them, at each trial choosing the stimulus which is expected to minimize the entropy of the posterior probability distribution over a set of competing models. We show the advantages of adaptive design in simulation study. We then present data from an experiment in which the method was applied to discriminate between competing models of category learning, including an exemplar model (the Generalized Context Model) and a decision bound model."], "link": "http://bps-msc.blogspot.com/feeds/1262362301565637954/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"https://docs.google.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "BPS Mathematics, Statistics & Computing Section"}, {"content": ["Wiley-Blackwell is proud to publish the British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology on behalf of The British Psychological Society .

New models for psychological processes, new approaches to existing data, critiques of existing models and improved algorithms for estimating the parameters of a model are examples of articles which may be favoured.

Contacts: Professor Thom Baguley Thomas.BaguleyATntuDOTacDOTuk Dr Gillian Smith Gillian.SmithATntuDOTacDOTuk Dr Danny Kaye Danny.KayeATntuDOTacDOTuk Emails : We would like to create an email list to share with other delegates and the session leaders. If you wish to be included please email me (Thomas.BaguleyATntuDOTacDOTuk) requesting this (we are not permitted to circulate the list without permission). Travel directions By public transport. The easiest way to get to Nottingham Trent University, City Campus (Campus Map) is by train and tram. Trams go direct from Nottingham train station to Nottingham Trent University every few minutes throughout the day. An all day tram ticket will cost about \u00a33.00 (buy a ticket from the conductor on the tram; he or she will be able to provide change, from \u00a310 or less). The Nottingham Trent University tram stop is just outside the Chaucer building main reception (on the same side of the street). The Division of Psychology is based on the 4th floor of the Chaucer Building. The registration desk for the workshop will be at the Psychology entrance (also on the 4th floor!). Please feel free to ask the security personnel on the front desk for assistance if you require. By car. The easiest method is park and ride. Either travel to East Midlands Parkway (train station) and park your car and take the train to Nottingham, followed by tram (as above). You can buy a combined train and parking ticket. Or travel to The Forest Park and Ride, park your car and take the tram (as above; except you\u2019ll be coming in from the other direction and will need to cross the road to get to the Chaucer building). Parking is free. Parking in central Nottingham. Parking in central Nottingham is expensive \u2013 probably around \u00a315-20 per day (but there are usually plenty of places in the Trinity Square or Victoria Centre car parks). The one-way system is also very difficult to navigate unless you are familiar with the city. We may be able to organize one or two visitors parking spaces at the Gill Street car park (see tram stop map above), but this is still not recommended (as getting through the one-way system in rush hour morning traffic is difficult unless you know the roads well). There is also a guide to getting to NTU here Monday evening: The organizers and session leaders plan to have an informal drink and a meal after the workshop. Delegates are warmly invited to join us. We will meet in the Chaucer Building foyer at 6.30pm (to allow a short break after the session). You are warmly invited to attend. ____________________________________________________________________ Day 2 BPS Maths, Stats and Computing Section Annual Scientific Meeting Directions: Are as above, however, the Annual Scientific Meeting will be held in the Newton Building (this building is further up Goldsmith Street on the other side of the street from the Chaucer Building). Please see here for details (Campus Map) Registration Will be between 9-9.30 in the foyer of Newton Building. There will be signs, around the building, and feel free to ask the security on the front desk (main entrance is on Goldsmith Street) should you require any assistance. If you have not already, please email Gillian.SmithATntuDOTacDOTuk to let us know you are planning to attend day two. It is a free event.  We look forward to welcoming you to NTU"], "link": "http://bps-msc.blogspot.com/feeds/6008622108547827673/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "BPS Mathematics, Statistics & Computing Section"}, {"content": ["BPS Mathematical, Statistical and Computing Section Annual Scientific Meeting Programme 14th December 2010    Time    9.30am- 9.45am  Welcome    9.45am- 10.15am  Dr Glenn A.
