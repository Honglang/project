Most people just don\u2019t know how to effectively harness the best new ideas, services and products. That is what this article is about: identifying and incorporating the latest trends. \n A trend is simply the general direction in which something is developing or changing. Staying current on the latest trends is vital. Why? If you become stagnant you become more and more irrelevant. As I recently wrote , relevance is directly related to trust and trust is the currency of the internet age. \n Really, staying on top of the latest trends is pretty easy\u2013if you know what to look for. It\u2019s not every day that someone will tell you the latest trends in a given topic ( like I did recently in a post titled 100 Must-Know Social Media Tidbits for 2013 ). That\u2019s nice when it happens, but you should take a more proactive and deeper approach to trend spotting. \n First you must identify which industries affect your business or mission (you can learn from any trendsetter whether or not they are in your specific industry or not).\u00a0Second, you must identify \u201ctrend hotspots\u201d or outlets where trends and trendsetters are regularly discovered and discussed and subscribe to their content. Finding these sources is key because they stay on top of the trends for you. You should find and utilize only the top resource so as to not become overwhelmed. Third you must curate (select and organize) the content that you want to make use of. Fourth you must put that content, that knowledge, to use in a way that will make a positive impact on your bottom line. \n 4 Steps to Trend Spotting \n To recap, it takes four steps to stay on top of the latest trends: \n \n Find Innovation \u2013 Identify which industries are pumping out ideas that could positively affect your business. \n Follow Innovation \u2013 Identify \u201ctrend hotspots\u201d or sources that cover specific industry trends and subscribe. \n Focus Innovation \u2013 Curate the curators. Weed out the useless info and save/favorite/bookmark the good stuff. \n Fuel Innovation \u2013 Assimilate the best new ideas and products into your workflow, marketing, business plan, etc. \n \n Finding the best new products and ideas is relatively simple, as you will see, but sorting through them is the tricky part. Luckily I\u2019ve got you covered. Awhile back I wrote a post titled: The 50+ Best Ways to Curate and Share Your Favorite Social Media and News Content . There are some amazing curation tools there but let me recommend a few of my favorite that you can use as part of the trend curation process: \n Flipboard , as I wrote about awhile back, is an amazing way to absorb information on a smartphone or tablet. It has been out for awhile but this is still the best way I can think of for staying on top of the latest content coming from your favorite blogs. Evernote , which I\u2019ve also covered before , is also an amazing way to organize information. Finally, be sure to check out Faveous , Paper.li , Storify , The Tweeted Times and Keepstream . \n Now let me make things really simple for you. I\u2019ve identified a few industries and \u201ctrend hotspots\u201d within those industries that you can simply plug in to your favorite curation software/product/process to stay on top of the latest and best trends and trendsetters. Consider this a starting point. You might have other areas and sources you\u2019d like to add as well (leave a comment to let me know what you would include). \n Design \n Hotspot: Fast Co.

Recently I\u2019ve been focusing on ways to develop a relevant content strategy and one piece of the puzzle is audience awareness\u2013obviously. But knowing your audience and effectively engaging with them are two entirely separate things. So, my big idea was the illustration you\u2019ll find below which is meant to help people better understand how to effectively target specific audiences. \n Before getting too deep, take note of this syllogistic paragraph as it puts everything into perspective for you: Be more relevant and your target audience will spend more time with your brand. The more time people spend with your brand the more engaged they become. Exposure and engagement build trust. Trust is brand currency. Therefore, relevance affects trust levels. The more people trust you, the more likely they are to buy into your message. \n This chart turns that paragraph into an actual graph: \n \n Audience Awareness Factors \n People (represented here by arrows) fit into groups aka audiences. When dealing with these groups of people, there are all these different factors that determine what person fits into what audience. Things like: \n \n Age \n Gender \n Expectations \n Interests \n Culture \n Habits \n Needs \n Style \n \n \n There are probably many more, but these are depicted in the chart above as the gray pyramid shape in the top of the circle. When you are designing a solution for reaching your target market you must account for these factors. They are targets to be aimed at. The more audience awareness factors you hit, the better your changes of striking a bullseye. If you are really firing on all cylinders, your content strategy will be represented by the perfectly vertical arrow labeled 8. Obviously, the more targets you git, the better. \n Brand Exposure and Trust \n The bottom half of the circle represents time (exposure) a person spends with your brand AND the trust they build up as a result. They go hand in hand in my estimation. You\u2019ll notice that some arrows bisecting the bottom half spend more time in certain colored areas (red=low, blue=medium, green=high) than others. More exposure means more trust. It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s one reason why you are more likely to take your friend\u2019s \u201cword for it\u201d than a strangers. It is why Facebook and myriad brands want you to make product recommendations and endorsements for your friends to see. \n Relevancy vs Engagement \n This is the good stuff where everything comes together. The \u201cangle of relevancy\u201d correlates directly to a person\u2019s level of engagement. This means that depending on the angle of approach you take to reach your audience you will hit a number of different audience awareness factors. The more the merrier. Shoot straight and you\u2019ll hit as many as possible. Come in from a side angle and you may only hit 2 or 3. \n Take Action \n To get the best possible response from your audience, it will be important to try to hit at least HALF of the identifiable audience awareness targets. But don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t achieve this on your very first attempt. Why? Each interaction with your brand, even on a lower level, will function as an advertisement. It\u2019s a relationship building exercise. When it comes time for them to make a purchasing decision, for example, who are they going to go with? A brand they are familiar with or a \u201ccold caller\u201d so to speak? \n Here\u2019s what you need to do to to become relevant to your target audience and build a long-term relationship built on trust and engagement: \n \n Identify key targets (expectations, interests, habits, style, etc.) you can aim for in order to reach your ideal audience. \n Based on these attributes, create content that will \u201cfire on all cylinders.\u201d \n Don\u2019t stop there. Continue tweaking your strategy by adding new targets as they become important. \n Pursue a relationship of trust with your customers. It will pay off\u2013big time. \n \n What do you think? Do you have anything to add?"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Dailytekk/~3/LTb3YujdFF0/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "DailyTekk"}, {"content": ["Innovators.

Shepherding over $1 Billion worth of movie projects through Hollywood, Mark managed to lose only one of the two things he attempted to maintain throughout his career: his sanity and his sense of humor. Having been all over the world making films, worked with some of the greatest actors, writers and directors, and watched a film he produced World Premiere from the Tsar of Russia\u2019s private box in St. Petersburg, Wolfe has proven that film school was actually a good idea and is glad he didn\u2019t try medical school after all. Mark produced two films in which LeVar Burton either directed or starred, leading to a friendship and business partnership in Burton/Wolfe Entertainment , a company founded on the principles of \u201cdoing well by doing good.\u201d With Burton/Wolfe\u2019s creation of RRKidz and the acquisition of Reading Rainbow, Wolfe now finds himself shuttling between LA and San Francisco pretending to understand technology despite his inability to successfully utilize a pencil sharpener. \n What do you enjoy most about your work and why? \n Right now, all over the world, thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of people are enjoying some movie, TV show or project that I am responsible for. The knowledge that the work we do in Hollywood can entertain, enlighten and educate strangers I will never meet makes it all worthwhile. With Reading Rainbow and RRKIDZ, hearing our customers tell us how their children, never readers before, suddenly embrace and look forward to the stories we are telling makes \u201cwork\u201d a true pleasure. Starting with nothing but an idea and a blank whiteboard and a year or so later seeing it become reality in homes all over the world, that\u2019s the most enjoyable part of what I do. \n Where does your passion come from? What drives you, inspires you, excites you? \n Storytelling, whether professionally or just hanging with friends and talking, I am in love with stories. When you combine that passion with the ability through media to have your story heard, that\u2019s what excites me. \n Someone reading this wants to start a tech company. What\u2019s your best advice for them? \n Don\u2019t : ) However if they still want to, my advice is the same advice as for someone wanting to start any business or create any product: know your audience\u2026 your consumer. What do they want and why is that thing you are making going to be something they want? If you create just for yourself, you run the risk of making something amazing that no one will ever see. Specifically for tech, I encourage everyone to make sure you combine in your senior management very tech savvy people with very product savvy people. One without the other is a recipe for failure. When my business partner LeVar Burton and I spoke to people in the Silicon Valley early on in RRKIDZ life, we heard a similar story. Many savvy people can create great tech but don\u2019t have strengths in user experience, whereas Hollywood is all about user experience but often doesn\u2019t spend enough time understanding the technology side. Combine the two: Tech and UX. \n What are a few tech startups that you\u2019re really excited about right now and why? \n Ours and any others that are trying to bring education to children. Games are awesome and fun is an imperative part of human existence, but there are a million apps and companies out there making games. LeVar says \u201cAll technology is educational; the question is,\u00a0 what are we teaching? \u201d I believe in that. Exciting start ups are the ones that help children learn and engage as well as be entertained. \n What tech tools (websites, apps, gadgets, etc.) do you rely on both for work and in your down time? \n My iPad is my portable life, both at work and at home and on the road. Its all in one \u2013 entertainment, productive, and practical. And MAPS of any kind. Without navigation programs and tools, I would be still looking for the Hollywood Sign somewhere driving through Atlanta. I use Pandora all the time for music everywhere. And Google . With Google, I can ask any question ever imagined and find out the answer instantly\u2026 how amazing is that?

Good change, that is, because you really have no control over bad change. You can\u2019t just sit and wait for life to happen to you and expect to wind up with a promotion or a job your more passionate about. \n Example: I recently came up with a killer idea, shared it with my boss who shared it with his bosses boss who is the head of our organization in North America. Now my boss and I have a meeting at the North American headquarters to see if the idea will get funded. I\u2019m excited because I am passionate about the work that could be done (by me and others) if the idea gets the green light. It is what I want to do with my life and I am pursuing it. \n If I had never spoken up and shared this idea (which really has nothing to do with my current position) with my boss I would never even have the chance to follow my true passion. \n Are you missing out on following your passion? What can you do to create the change you want to see?"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Dailytekk/~3/2J9o25zmDT0/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "DailyTekk"}, {"content": ["There is a reason why some people are more successful than others. Actually, there are many reasons, but I\u2019m convinced that one of them is this: people don\u2019t want to do hard things, as a general rule, so the few that are willing/able/unafraid to endure a bit of hardship are the ones who are going to come out looking like they accomplished something. Respect, money and even fame are most likely going to follow to some degree. \n Take Bear Grylls for example. You don\u2019t want to eat nasty insects and drink your own urine for the enjoyment of millions of viewers. You probably wouldn\u2019t even want to go through the special forces training he had to endure before he ever made it on TV. But he did it and look what it got him. \n Do you see what I mean? You\u2019ve got to be willing to do something other people aren\u2019t in order to get ahead. This could take many forms. The classic example is being an entrepreneur and trading in the safety of a steady job for the uncertainty of fledging a new company that may or may not make it in the end. It may look like taking more initiative with your boss or learning how to speak up. It could look like starting a blog that nobody reads for 6 months but being sticking with it till it finds an audience. Patience, persistence, the ability to envision the future, optimism and a higher pain tolerance are all hallmarks of successful people. \n Many people have given up on doing something respectable to gain attention and they do something terrible that nobody else is willing to do (like give up their dignity by dressing skimpy to sell music). Some people aren\u2019t willing to trample others underfoot to climb to the top. Either way, doing something that hurts you or someone else is not the way to go. \n If you are tired of the same old routine in your life or if you have big dreams you want to accomplish, you can\u2019t be afraid to give up a bit of comfort for the short term in order to gain something better for yourself in the long term. It\u2019s not for everybody\u2026 that\u2019s why some people are more successful than others. \n What do you think?"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Dailytekk/~3/XPdV0MoxSas/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://dailytekk.com/": 1, "http://www.beargrylls.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "DailyTekk"}, {"content": ["You\u2019re about to feast your lucky eyes on 20 of the most fun, unique, cool and, of course, useful iPad accessories the world has ever known.

I happen to mean it in the Adam-Sandler-thinks-he-got-a-free-Ferrari way (see Bedtime Stories for more information). Your social media skills, on the other hand, may just be plain ol\u2019 sick\u2013diseased, unwell, ailing. Here, let\u2019s do a quick test to determine which type of sickness you have: Do you understand the basic difference between being on social media and doing something on social media? \u00a0If so; siiiiiick! \u00a0If not; just sick. If you fall into the latter category, consider this post your social media-cine. \n Bottom line? If you are looking for a way to shine on social media, to go above and beyond, to completely outdo your competition and to have a chance at making a real dent in the online universe (and maybe even the rest of the universe as well), this post is for you. If nothing else, you\u2019ll come away with a better understanding of how social media does and does not work. \n Overview \n \n Don\u2019t just put your brand\u00a0 on \u00a0social media\u2013 do\u00a0something with social media. Otherwise you are merely existing. \n Never, under any circumstances, at any time, for any reason disappoint your audience. Good first impressions can only be made once. \n Creativity is ESSENTIAL. If your company doesn\u2019t bleed creativity, give your culture a transfusion. \n Don\u2019t take a one-size-fits-all approach to social media. Identify your audience and learn to speak their language. \n Start kissing your wallet\u2013you have to put your money where your mouth is to market on social media. \n If you know no trends, you\u2019ll have no friends. Don\u2019t be \u201cthat guy\u201d who calls Facebook an emerging technology 10 years after it emerged. \n \n Social Media is Just Plain Dumb\u2026 Without Smart Content \n As human beings all people may be created equal, but when it comes to social media managers (from wannabes to professionals and the strategies they employ), the same simply cannot be said. When I hear people who represent a brand, even and especially \u201ccommunication professionals,\u201d say that they are \u201con social media,\u201d I cringe. What they really mean is that they have created a Twitter account or Facebook page for their brand (maybe they have even created a Pinboard\u2013woohoo). I think to myself, \u201cCongratulations chief, you exist on a social network. Nay, you merely exist on a social network.\u201d It\u2019s the equivalent of a person who merely exists in life. So what. A rock exists too and so does a landfill, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am going to be particularly interested in them. To really live you have to get out there and do something . It\u2019s the same with social media. Stellar content is what can bring your social media content to life.\u00a0It\u2019s like the difference between a \u201csmart phone\u201d and a \u201cdumb phone.\u201d Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are \u00a0just delivery systems. They are pipes through which information can flow. \n Can you see what I\u2019m getting at? Just being on social media means essentially nothing. You have to do something with it. I\u2019ll go even further and say that simply doing the basics on social media (post an update here and a photo there) is nearly just as bad. If that is what you do, seriously, just delete your account right now\u2013or\u2013be content being extremely average, never winning any awards or making a serious difference. There is danger in mere existence\u2026 read on. \n There\u2019s No Appointment Like Disappointment \n When I talk about social media, one of my favorite exercises is this: I come up with a silly competition that will yield a quick winner (such as who has the most Twitter followers, for example) and state that there will be a cash prize. I then proceed to write on the whiteboard (if available) what the envelope I am holding contains. I write a one and say, \u201cThere will be one of these,\u201d followed by two circles and state, \u201cAnd there will be two of these.\u201d Naturally, everyone assumes there is $100 in the envelope. When I hand the lucky winner the prize and ask them to open it, they find a $1 bill with two pennies taped to it. So\u2026 there definitely was a one and there were two circles\u2026 but not what the poor recipient expected ($100 poorer to be exact\u2013bad joke). As I describe the disappointment the victim must feel, a shared sense of being severely bummed out spreads throughout the room. \u00a0And just like that, I\u2019ve illustrated the disappointment people feel when they expect something great from you and get ripped off instead (I give the person a free shirt or other sponsor-supplied prize afterwords\u2026 still, not as good as $100). \n Lesson? If you have something great going on in the real world (an awesome brick and mortar store, for example) and people jump online and see a website that looks like it came from the beginning of the internet or a social media profile that is beyond lame\u2013if there is any sense of disappointment at all\u2013you just failed big time. You can\u2019t take back a person\u2019s first experience with your brand. If it bombs, you may never see them again or it\u2019s going to be very hard to get them to look at you in a more favorable light. Don\u2019t disappoint. I\u2019ve actually got a friend who can help you accomplish this\u2026 \n Introducing Mr. Cre A. Tivity \n Does his name sound foreign to you? No, he\u2019s not from a different country and yes he wants to be your friend too. This is a very serious metaphorical question: Do you bleed creativity? If not, then the reason is probably because its not built-in to your DNA (or the DNA of your company/organization). It\u2019s not something you can fake, but it is something you desperately need if you want to kill it on social media. Why? People crave creativity \u00a0(<\u2013 you must read this link). In fact, they demand it. You do too, whether you know it or not. If you don\u2019t want to disappoint your audience/customers, you have to be creative. To go from merely existing online to making someone explain, \u201cWow, this exists?\u201d \u00a0requires creativity in large and small doses. \n So what does creativity look like in social media? I guess it doesn\u2019t hurt to spruce your profile up a bit, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about content. Here are a few examples . If you aren\u2019t creative, hire someone that is. If you can\u2019t afford to hire someone, start thinking about what you can do that is different than what else is out there. Sometimes creativity is hard to capture\u2013that\u2019s why people who successfully translate creative ideas into reality soar above the competition. It\u2019s rare to encounter. Need to get the creative juices flowing? Fill up your tank with some serious idea fuel . \n Me No Talky English \n Wouldn\u2019t it be great if there was an app that translated your business jargon into your target audience\u2019s preferred dialect? By the way, who is your audience? Who do you want to reach with your message/products? And the million-dollar question: can you speak their language? Can you communicate effectively with them? Example: Many Christian churches look more like museums than movements these days. Why? Aging generations, those in control of operations, no longer know how to reach out to younger generations\u2013they don\u2019t speak the same language. I\u2019m not talking about simple slang here. We live in the age of technology where culture gaps intersect with generation gaps to form killer monster gaps that only grow bigger with time. Whoever your audience is, you must reach them how they want to be reached. You must go where they are. You must talk like they talk. Imagine parachuting into another county and not being able to speak the language (I\u2019m picturing China right now, since I can\u2019t speak Chinese). You\u2019d feel pretty out of place, wouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019d probably want to get out of there as soon as possible.\u00a0You simply can\u2019t communicate without language. Period. \n Thanks to social media, you can now micro-target sub-audiences; theres no need to take a shotgun-style approach to marketing these days. In fact, I\u2019d consider that a bit lazy. If you know you want to target 18-24 year olds, you can now easily and relatively inexpensively reach out to both males and females in that same demographic with separate assets. First, though, take the time to understand who you are talking to.\u00a0Identify not only who your audience is, but what makes them tick: age, gender, habits, needs, wants, culture, pain points, etc\u2026 What are they seeing on a daily basis? What would not only make sense to them, but what would stand out to them? And that is where Mr. Cre A. Tivity comes in. \n Start Kissing Your Wallet \n Why? It\u2019s time to put your money where your mouth is. You want to reach people on social media. Fine, but social media marketing is not as free as you\u2019d like to think. Case in point? Examine my list of 100+ professional social media tools. Click through some of the links. Most aren\u2019t free and many are quite expensive to use. Sure, it\u2019s free to signup for a Twitter or Facebook account, I\u2019ll give you that. But what is the only way to amplify word-of-mouth marketing online? By spending money. Promoting a link on Twitter can cost $120,000 per day. Want to sponsor a content ad on Facebook for a month? Hope you are ready to part with $800,000. It\u2019s time to stop treating social media marketing like an ugly step-child and fork over some money to 1.) pay people who are more creative than you to do creative things on your behalf, 2.) buy some professional social media monitoring and marketing tools/services and 3.) hire writers/designers/videographers to produce high-quality and effective content you can be proud to post. You know the drill: it takes money to make money and that is no different when it comes to social media. \n If You Know No Trends, You\u2019ll Have No Friends \n I bet that if you and I were to take turns naming social networking platforms one at a time I would stomp you into the ground. Sure, I spend a lot of time researching the subject and do a lot of thinking/writing about social media, but still, if you are tasked with managing your brand\u2019s social media marketing\u2026 you should be up on the latest trends. Facebook and Twitter do not count. Even Pinterest is mainstream now. If you know about Path, Pair, OurSpot, Highlight, Sonar, etc\u2026 you\u2019re doing better. At least you are current. But what is on the horizon? Where is your audience engaging? There are interest-based networks, location-based networks, private networks for families\u2026 the list goes on and on and gets longer every day (so it seems). \n I saved this until the end because, while it is very important to know what social networks are available to you and your audience, it doesn\u2019t really mean anything without the principles I\u2019ve already laid out above.
