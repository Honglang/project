The package has been mentionned in an article in the open source blog from Google . \n \n The package defines classes int64 and uint64 that represent signed and unsigned 64 bit integer vectors. The package also allows conversion of several types (integer, numeric, character, logical) to 64 bit integer vectors, arithmetic operations as well as other standard group generic functions, and reading 64 bit integer vectors as a data.frame column using int64 or uint64 as the colClasses argument. \n\n The package has a vignette that details its features, several examples are given in the usual help files. Once again, I've used RUnit for quality insurance about the package code \n\n int64 has been developped so that 64 bit integer vectors are represented using only R data structures, i.e data is not represented as external pointers to some C++ object. Instead, each 64 bit integer is represented as a couple of regular 32 bit integers, each of them carrying half the bits of the underlying 64 bit integer. This was a choice by design so that 64 bit integer vectors can be serialized and used as data frame columns. \n\n The package contains C++ headers that third party packages can used (via LinkingTo: int64) to use the C++ internals. This allows creation and manipulation of the objects in C++. The internals will be documented in another vignette for package developpers who wish to use the internals. For the moment, the main entry point is the C++ template class LongVector. \n\n I'm particularly proud that Google trusted me to sponsor the development of int64 . The next versions of packages Rcpp and RProtoBuf take advantage of the facilities of int64 , e.g. Rcpp gains wrapping of C++ containers of 64 bit integers as R objects of classes int64 and uint64 and RProtoBuf improves handling of 64 bit integers in protobuf messages.

The focus will be on simple and\n straightforward applications of Rcpp in order to extend R and/or\n to significantly accelerate the execution of simple functions. \n\n The tutorial will cover the inline package which permits embedding of\n self-contained C, C++ or Fortran code in R scripts. We will also discuss\n RInside to embed R code in C++ applications, as well as standard Rcpp\n extension packages such as RcppArmadillo for linear algebra and RcppGSL. \n\n\n Afternoon session: \"Advanced R and C++ topics\" \n\n This afternoon tutorial will provide a hands-on introduction to more\n advanced Rcpp features. It will cover topics such as writing packages that\n use Rcpp, how 'Rcpp modules' and the new R ReferenceClasses interact, and\n how 'Rcpp sugar' lets us write C++ code that is often as expressive as R\n code. Another possible topic, time permitting, may be writing glue code to\n extend Rcpp to other C++ projects. \n\n We also hope to leave some time to discuss problems brought by the class\n participants. \n\n\n Prerequisites \n\n Knowledge of R as well as general programming knowledge; C or C++ knowledge\n is helpful but not required. \n\n Users should bring a laptop set up so that R packages can be built. That\n means on Windows, Rtools needs to be present and working, and on OS X the\n Xcode package should be installed. \n\t  \n Registration \n\n Registration is available via the R/Finance conference at \n\n\t\t  http://www.RinFinance.com/register/ \n\n or directly at RegOnline \n\n\t\t  http://www.regonline.com/930153 \n\n The cost is USD 500 for the whole day, and space will be limited.  \n\n\n Questions \n\n Please contact us directly at RomainAndDirk@r-enthusiasts.com"], "link": "http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2011/03/30/Rcpp-workshop-in-Chicago-on-April-28th", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://romainfrancois.free.fr/": 1, "http://www.RinFinance.com/": 1, "http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/": 2, "http://www.regonline.com/": 1, "http://www.RinFinance.com": 1}, "blogtitle": "Romain Francois, Professional R Enthusiast"}, {"content": ["I'll play my 40 minutes one man show in Montpellier on March 15th, and a small extract at the next Montpellier Com\u00e9die Club next wednesday"], "link": "http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2011/03/03/Eponyme-%3A-40-minutes-stand-up", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://romainfrancois.free.fr/": 1, "http://www.facebook.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Romain Francois, Professional R Enthusiast"}, {"content": ["I'll present Rcpp at the inaugural Geneva-R meeting. \n\n Geneva-R is an informal gathering of R enthusiasts sponsored by Mango Solutions , that builds on the success of London-R , where I presented twice, and Basel-R"], "link": "http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2011/03/02/Rcpp-at-Geneva-R", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://mango-solutions.com/": 1, "http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/": 1, "http://www.londonr.org/": 1, "http://www.baselr.org/": 1, "http://www.geneva-r.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Romain Francois, Professional R Enthusiast"}, {"content": ["After years of resistance, here I am on facebook"], "link": "http://romainfrancois.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2011/01/28/Facebook-me%2C-I-m-famous", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.facebook.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Romain Francois, Professional R Enthusiast"}]
