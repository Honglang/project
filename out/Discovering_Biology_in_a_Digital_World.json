Could this kind of model work? \n \n Two arguments support this idea. \n \n 1. \u00a0Volume sales \n 2. \u00a0The cost of creation \n \n \n Volume sales \n Volume sales work like this. \u00a0Let\u2019s say a publisher sells 10 papers at $30 each. \u00a0This brings in $300. \n \n That same publisher could also bring in $300 by selling 100 papers at $3 each. \n \n They could earn the same of money but get materials out to more people. \n \n Will the volume be there? \u00a0The experiment hasn\u2019t been tried. \n \n \n The cost of creation \n Many people have noted that most of the cost of creating a scientific publication is funded by taxpayers through government grants.

The reasoning behind this requirement is that taxpayers funded everything about the research except for the final publication, and so they have already paid for access. \n The Research Works Act ( #RWA ), HR 3699, is a bill in the House of Representatives that would roll back this requirement. If it passes, taxpayers will most likely have to pay exorbitant fees for access to publicly-funded research. I\u2019ll explain why in a moment. \n The Research Works Act will harm science education because students and instructors at small colleges and community colleges generally lack access to scientific journals and we will no longer be able to afford to use scientific literature in our courses. \n \n How much does it cost? \n \n One commenter on a my earlier post about the effect on science education noted that students and others would still be able to purchase research articles if RWA passes. \n I thought, dear readers, you might like to know what that privilege is likely to cost. \n \n What does a personal subscription cost today? \n Today, a one year personal subscription to Science costs $149 for a member and $75 for a student. A personal subscription for one year of Nature costs $199. We subscribe to both and pay $350 a year for the privilege. \n The problem is that working in science, and learning about science, requires looking at papers from multiple journals and multiple years from those journals. \n Access to one journal is rarely sufficient. \n Let\u2019s look at the subscription costs for some other journals. \n Two other journals that I frequently use are Nature Genetics and Nature Biotechnology. These cost $225 per year and $250 per year, respectively. \n \nHere are the yearly subscription costs for a few of the other Nature journals: \n \n$503 Acta Pharmacologica Sinica \n$586 American Journal of Hypertension \n$319 Asian Journal of Andrology \n$865 Bone Marrow Transplantation \n$99 BoneKEy Reports \n$474 British Dental Journal \n$569 British Journal of Cancer \n$542 Cancer Gene Therapy \n$417 Cell Death and Differentiation \n$417 Cell Research \n At $865 per year, a personal subscription to the on-line only version, of Bone Marrow Transplantation would be hard for me to justify. But then, I\u2019m not an M.D. \n \nNow, consider Nature has 91 publications, with many subscription costs over $300 per year for each journal. I\u2019ve been told that library subscriptions are more costly than personal subscriptions. Is it really that surprising that our libraries say no? \n \n What do individual articles cost? \n Could we get by with having students read individual articles? \n \nI looked up the prices for individual articles from some of the journals that I use. \n \nThe table below shows the costs to purchase a single article from 14 different journals. \n \n  \n \nOut the 14 journals, 9 of them charge $30 per article or more. I looked at multiple Nature journals since the prices for each journal subscription varied so widely. \n Many times when we have students research a topic, we want them to look at multiple articles from multiple journals. Students might need to look at ten papers to complete an assignment. \n We also tend to have students investigate different topics. This means that we can\u2019t just give every student the same set of articles. Each student needs to get multiple articles from multiple sources, and each article could cost $30-35 at today\u2019s prices. Today, we can make do by having students stick to open access articles. RWA will kill that option. \n If papers were priced more reasonably, like songs in iTunes, we instructors would find RWA less alarming. But as it stands, if publishers charge the all articles with the prices they\u2019re using now, it will kill our ability to use the literature in the classroom."], "link": "http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2012/01/09/how-much-does-it-cost-to-get-a/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"https://twitter.com/": 1, "http://scienceblogs.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Discovering Biology in a Digital World"}, {"content": ["The C.R.E.A.T.E. strategy is an approach to making biology teaching a better model of biology, the science. \n From the C.R.E.A.T.E website , \n \u2026C.R.E.A.T.E. teaching focuses on on authentic published work\u2013peer reviewed journal articles\u2013with students reading either series of papers produced sequentially from individual labs or series of papers from different labs focused on a single line of research. \n This summer and next, the National Science Foundation is funding two identical workshops designed to help instructors learn how to use the C.R.E.A.T.E. strategy. \n These will be held in June 2012 and 2013 at Hobart College and William Smith College, in Geneva, New York.

Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (New York) and Congressman Darrell Issa (California) are co-sponsoring a bill to restore the limits on public access to NIH-funded research. \n \nI\u2019ve written many times before ( here , here , here , and here ) about the challenges that community college faculty and students have in getting access to scientific papers. \n \nIn an era where the economic benefits of educating students in science are well-known (1), the idea of crippling science education by cutting off access to the primary literature is puzzling. If anything, I would expect congress to support science education by asking the National Science Foundation (NSF) to follow NIH\u2019s lead and require that publications from NSF funded research be made open access, too. \n \nInstead, bill H.R. 3699 will roll back the NIH Public Access Policy and block similar policies at other federal agencies. The effects would be horrific. \n \nMaloney and Issa might not be aware of this, but faculty and students at 1,167 community and technical colleges will be negatively impacted by this bill (2). Many community college faculty rely on open access materials. Not only are these publications important tools for keeping our understanding current, we rely on these publications to help educate our students. \n \n How we use primary literature in biotechnology education \nUnlike the faculty in research universities, many of the instructors in community college biotech programs are scientists with backgrounds in the biotech industry. These instructors routinely assign scientific papers as part of their courses since they are training biotechnology technicians and industry technicians are expected to be able to read this type of literature. \n Industry advisory boards also encourage the use of primary literature. At Austin Community College (Texas), students use research articles to design and write experimental protocols. At Shoreline Community College (Washington), students in the Molecular Biology course give presentations on research papers. I also refer students to the primary literature in my bioinformatics courses. And I draw extensively on primary literature when I design instructional materials and learning activities. \n Our educational practices will be severely impacted by restricting access to the literature. If we\u2019re required to purchase individual articles, often priced at $30 each, we will either have to end these practices or consider becoming Internet pirates sailing on the good ship Napster.pdf. \n \n Some of my experiences with the problems of accessing primary literature \nTwenty years ago, as a new college instructor, I was thrilled when PubMed became free and my students could start reading abstracts on-line. I still spent hours photocopying and organizing papers for student presentations and research projects but having access to abstracts was a great beginning. \n \nNot only did I want students to learn how to scientific papers, I wanted them to understand the difference between the primary literature and the articles you might read in the newspaper or popular magazines like Discover or Wired. I wanted students to see for themselves how some details might get left out, how the same details could be presented in different ways and multiple groups might arrive at different conclusions. \n My instructor colleagues and I were especially happy when NIH began to require that NIH-funded research be open to the public. Now, we could get papers ourselves and we could start requiring our students to read papers, too. Even some of the high school teachers I know started asking students to use PubMed and skim papers on topics like genetic disease. \n  \n Doing the hard thing isn\u2019t always easy \nIn the days when research papers were pay per view, many of us shied away from assigning primary research. After all, it\u2019s not realistic to expect students to spend $30 to download a single article, when we know large numbers of students skip buying textbooks because of the cost. \n What? Why didn\u2019t our students go to the library? Community colleges don\u2019t carry many journals since subscriptions are often too expensive. As a faculty member, we were told not to request journals since our library was prohibited from ordering them. \n \nA science instructor\u2019s task is made even harder since research articles are notoriously hard to read. Nevertheless, as instructors, we have an obligation to help students develop their reading skills. When our students don\u2019t have access to the materials we want them to ready, this goal gets all the harder to achieve. \n  \n \n \n An unequal education for all? \nRestricting access to the primary literature will have a negative impact on access to science education. According to the American Association for Community Colleges, 43% of all undergraduates attend community colleges. For the minority students, who attend college, these numbers can be even higher (2). Consider as well, that students, including those who become science teachers, take many of their science courses at community colleges. \n \nWhat benefit could there possibly be to society for congress to take away what might be the only chance these students have to learn how to read and critique scientific papers? \n \nIf we want to promote STEM education, why handicap faculty and students by prohibiting access to the tools? \n \n References : \n 1.

The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) will be funding genomics studies on Mendelian traits using a similar strategy. \n NHGRI will fund a small number of centers, dominant centers you might say, and look for large changes. The sequencing centers that will benefit are the Broad Institute, Washington University, and Baylor College of Medicine. For the next four years, the big three will be dividing $86 million a year according to a press release from NHGRI . I\u2019m not sure what algorithms predict a larger return from funding a smaller number of researchers, but the future looks like fun for those on a small budgets who can figure out how to slurp up the data and quickly spit out results. \n Studies on Mendelian disorders will benefit from the proposed funding plan as well. According to the NIH press release, only half of the estimated 6,000 rare diseases, inherited in a Mendelian pattern, have been linked to a genetic cause. Although each disease is rare, in combination, these diseases affect approximately 25 million Americans. Today\u2019s DNA sequencing technologies offer an unprecedented ability to find the basis for these diseases, particularly when the genomes of entire families are compared. \n Which brings us to clinical sequencing and new interesting issues. \n Earlier genetic tests raised all kinds of ethical controversies. Does everyone have a right to be tested? Should test results be shared with one\u2019s family? Should parents be allowed to test children? Should someone have a right to know, to not know, etc. Identifying all the stakeholders and their issues can make your head spin. \n And those tests typically looked at single genes. \n Today, when we sequence a genome, we will find much more information about many thousands more genes whether we want it or not. Genome sequencing is like remodeling. A simple quest to check out a foundation always goes along with the chance of finding water leaks or ant colonies. \n We could sequence a genome from a cancer patient for example, to determine the best drug for treatment, and uncover an undiagnosed predisposition to some other bad news of kind of trait.

The government wants information to better leverage our national investments in biological research and grow the jobs of the future. \n The RFI even addresses community colleges. The section on workforce development, in particular, point 10, asks: \n (10) What roles should community colleges play in training the bioeconomy workforce of the future? \n What might we tell them? \n And, why should we share this information? \n Here are some notes from our discussion: \n 1. Community colleges play a unrecognized role in post-baccalaureate education. \n Many students who attend community colleges have degrees from four-year institutions and universities. These students come to community college programs to learn job skills. Sometimes they\u2019re recent graduates from a four year institution. Sometimes these students have already been in the work force and wish to upgrade their training or learn new skills. \n Although, community college instructors are universally aware that we have large numbers of students with four-year degrees, it turns out that the role of community colleges in educating already-degreed students is not common knowledge. \n No one (except, perhaps, community college instructors) captures data about the number of students with degrees who attend community colleges, in any kind of systematic fashion. Four year colleges and Universities don\u2019t have these data and community colleges don\u2019t ask. \n We can help. \n If we have been collecting these data, the Whitehouse would like us to share this information. They want to learn more about the number of students at community colleges with bachelors degrees. I always survey my students, I have these data for the classes that I teach. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only instructor who does this. \n Describing our role in post-baccalaureate education is also important in combating the myopic definition of success currently promoted by the Gates Foundation, and others, that students are not successful unless they get a degree or certificate. It\u2019s ludicrous to consider a student, with a bachelors degree who takes a few classes at a community college and gets a job as a failure because they didn\u2019t get an additional degree or transfer to a four year school. We need to address this narrow viewpoint and help these groups expand the definition of success by sharing our data and experiences with post-baccalaureate students. \n 2. Community college Biotechnology Education programs are experts in developing and maintaining innovative public-private partnerships. \n Many community college biotech programs work closely with their local industry and contribute to the bioeconomy in numerous ways. Some colleges have small business incubators on campus. Other colleges have agreements with biotech incubators in terms of internships and staffing. The colleges agree to equip students with the proper skills and the incubators agree to provide internships. \n Some colleges have even started their own contract research organizations and small non-profit businesses to assist local companies and provide internship opportunities for their students. \n Some colleges have been able to purchase costly high-tech equipment through grants from the National Science Foundation\u2019s Advanced Technology Education program. Not only do some colleges use the equipment to train their students, they allow small companies to use the equipment in off hours. \n Some colleges work very closely with their state trade organizations. A skilled workforce is an asset when communities are trying to lure business to their area. If a trade organization works with a college, that trade organization will be better prepared to answer questions about the number of skilled alumni, and the educational capacity and training facilities at the school. \n Many of us, in Bio-Link , know how entrepreneurial community college programs can be, but these activities are unknown outside of the biotech education community. \n If your college is engaged in these kinds of activities, or other related activities, the Whitehouse wants that information. \n They need to know that almost every community college biotech program, and certainly every Bio-Link program has an industry advisory board, and works closely with industry to ensure that graduates are learning the skills that they need. \n 3. We need to share the fact that our community colleges have programs that specifically assist veterans and that many of them end up in biotech and medical device education programs. \n No one can fix laboratory equipment like a vet. And all small biotech companies and college science labs have broken equipment that needs fixing. \n Why should we respond to the RFI and share what we know? \n As many of us know, the biggest contributor to improving the abilities of community colleges to educate students and provide them with job skills in bioscience has been the Advanced Technology Education program at the National Science Foundation. \n Recent news reports have mentioned that the National Science Foundation plans to cut its education budget by almost 4%. ( Science magazine, Nov. 15, 2011 ) \n If we expect to be able to continue to educating students in advanced technology, and helping them get jobs, we need to let the world know what we do and share our ideas with the government. \n Send your answers to bioeconomy@ostp.gov by Dec. 6th. \n Responses to the RFI, including the names of the authors and their institutional affiliations, will be posted at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/bioeconomy ."], "link": "http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2011/11/25/community-colleges-and-the-bio/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://bio-link.org": 1, "http://www.federalregister.gov/": 1, "http://news.sciencemag.org/": 1, "http://www.whitehouse.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Discovering Biology in a Digital World"}, {"content": ["For the past few days I\u2019ve been avidly following Daniel MacArthur\u2019s tweets from the Personal Genome Conference at Cold Spring Harbor( @dgmacarthur #cshlpg ). \n The Personal Genomics tweets aren\u2019t just interesting because of the science, they\u2019re interesting because MacArthur and others have started to take on the conventional dogma in genetic ethics. \n For years, there has been a strong message from the clinical genetics and genetics education community that genetic information is dangerous. \n \n Unlike the other medical tests we\u2019re continually urged to get ( mammograms, blood pressure readings, sugar, colonoscopies ) genetic tests are presented, at least in teaching materials, as risky . According to many teaching materials, you should not get a genetic test, until you\u2019ve identified all the stake holders, and weighed all the pros and cons. Imagine if doctors used followed these procedures before reading someone\u2019s blood pressure or taking their temperature. The implication isn\u2019t stated, but the underlying message is clear: Genetic tests are different and more dangerous than conventional medical procedures . \n Ironically, much of the negative atmosphere around genetic information seems to have originated from ELSI. ELSI was a commitment on the part of the NIH to use 1% of the money allocated to sequencing the human genome to fund studies on the ethical, legal, and social implications of the human genome project. \n Instead, ELSI has produced several curricular materials that present genome sequencing as a \u201cbad idea.\u201d The biggest consequence of ELSI has been to turn the desire for one\u2019s own genomic information into something shameful. \n People who get their DNA sequences are equated with skydivers, speed racers, and winners of the Darwin awards. All the signs say \u201c Warning!! You are engaging in risky behavior that could endanger your family, job, and insurance policy .\u201d \n \n The top reasons for discouraging genetic testing \n The usual reasons that geneticists give for discouraging people from seeking genetic testing are: \n - the results are too complicated for most people to understand ( most people are too stupid? ) \n - the risks outweigh the benefits ( This could be true, but we rarely talk about the benefits, and we obsess about the risks. ) \n - it\u2019s expensive ( According to Atul Butte, by way of Daniel MacArthur\u2019s tweets, a colonscopy costs $6000. This is now 6x more expensive then having 23andme sequence your exome, plus you would get far more information .) \n \n It\u2019s not just the education community \n Some of tweets from MacArthur were on stories from Gholson Lyon on being unable to share findings from Next Generation DNA sequencing studies with patients. \n Patients in clinical studies must give their consent and acknowledge that they understand the risks of the study in order to participate. The forms that are used for consent are designed to protect patients and minimize risks. \n \nA problem with some clinical studies is that occasionally the researchers find medical problems in the participants that weren\u2019t known before the study. These kinds of findings are becoming more common with studies that sequence the entire genome. Unfortunately, the common practice has been to avoid returning this kind of \u201c incidental \u201d information back to the patients. After all, they didn\u2019t give their consent to receive it. \n \nMacAthur tweeted one story from Gholson Lyon where the researchers learned that a woman in a study, who was 4 months pregnant, was a carrier for a lethal disease. They weren\u2019t allowed to tell her this because of the IRB constraints, and the affected baby died.

Registration is free and you can register HERE . \n Jim is one of the most inspirational educators I know and he\u2019s the sort of person that reminds you why educating students about biotechnology careers is important. His moving story is one that always reminds me that there\u2019s more to biotechnology than just the science. \n \nOne of those is Jim deKloe. A long-time instructor at Solano Community College, Jim is an amazing individual and an accomplished educator. Full of humor and energy, when I first met him, it was shock to see Jim a few years later, when the ordeal (described below) was recent and the pain was fresh. \n No one can tell his story like Jim, so with Jim\u2019s permission, I invite you to read on. \n \n My Story \n By Jim deKloe \n I couldn\u2019t have written this story as a script for Hollywood. No one would have believed it. \n It was the Sunday morning after Thanksgiving, and my 4-year-old son, Jefferson, woke up at 5:30 with a 102-degree fever. He was fine the night before, even a little hyper in his happy-go-lucky way. He was sleeping in our bed and we did notice that he had some fever during the night, but Motrin easily brought it down. \n Then morning came, and the fever persisted. \n \u201c Should we take him to the emergency room? \u201d my wife, Laura, asked me that Sunday morning. \n \u201c I don\u2019t know ,\u201d I answered. \u201c Trust your instincts, what do your instincts say? \u201d \n \u201c My instincts say take him in ,\u201d she said. \u201c He just doesn\u2019t look right. \u201d \n Kids get fevers of 102 degrees often, and you don\u2019t want the triage officer at the emergency room to think you\u2019re a hypochondriac. But in this case, he didn\u2019t look right. His complexion was ashen. He spoke, but didn\u2019t make sense. \n We decided to take him to the ER. Had we hesitated, he would have been dead within hours. \n Staring into the abyss \nIt was a move that marked the beginning of a walk through darkness for my family, with days spent staring into the abyss. Jeff hung near death, infected with a deadly bacterium until a miracle drug developed by Genentech brought him back to us. A few years earlier I had helped make the drug for Genentech, which helped convince me it might work for Jeff. \n NorthBay Medical Center emergency room staff took the fever seriously and administered antibiotics. Jeff went in and out of consciousness. Laura pointed out a small rash on his chest to the doctor on duty, Dr. William Peterson. He immediately ordered a helicopter to airlift Jeff to Oakland Children\u2019s\u2019 Hospital. Had he not done that, Jeff would have died. \n Jeff had meningococcemia, an infection where bacteria enter the bloodstream. It\u2019s due to the same bacterium that\u2019s responsible for meningitis, but in this disease the bacterium jumps into the blood rather than into the fluid surrounding the spine. Textbooks report that it has a mortality rate of somewhere between 50 and 80 percent (with death often occurring within hours of outset). \n Jeff\u2019s grandfather, a pediatrician in practice for 40 years, had not heard of any kids surviving this. When he got the call with the diagnosis that afternoon, he drove from Orange County to Oakland. He assumed he was driving to his grandson\u2019s funeral. \n The bloodstream is one of the only places on the planet that is bacteria-free. There are live bacteria atop the highest mountains, in the deepest part of the ocean, in volcanic hot springs, and in Antarctic snow banks. If there are bacteria in the blood, a condition called septicemia, it is always life threatening. And these particular bacteria are bad news. \n Antibiotics kill them easily, but that\u2019s when the real trouble begins. \nWhen you treat them with antibiotics, you go from the frying pan into the fire. You\u2019ve got to do it; you can\u2019t stay in the frying pan. As the bacteria die, they throw a component of their outer membrane into the bloodstream. This is called endotoxin, and it has a couple of dramatic and awful effects. \n It isn\u2019t that the molecule itself is toxic, but it triggers the immune system to go wild. It induces shock and blood pressure crashes. Science writer Lewis Thomas describes the immune system as containing munitions and this condition as an explosion in the munitions factory. \n \u2018Your son is very sick \u2013 prepare yourself\u2019 \nAs Jeff was airlifted, his blood pressure crashed. The helicopter paramedic team from REACH, and the Intensive Care Unit at Oakland, set up an IV, began fluids and started epinephrine (adrenaline) that props up blood pressure. The intravenous fluids also boost the blood pressure as fluids leak out of the blood vessels into the surrounding tissues. \n Jeff had a net gain of 5 liters of liquid on that first day \u2013 more than 10 pounds. And this in a boy who doesn\u2019t even weigh 40 pounds \u2013 a 25 percent gain in weight. Jeff had the fulminate form of this disease, which means that his blood began to clot. \n The rash that Dr. Peterson saw was the beginning of the clotting process. The broken down pieces of bacteria trigger clotting. And they clot everywhere. The condition is called DIC, diffuse intracapillary coagulation. The clotting spread to Jeff\u2019s head, and down his body. By the time he reached the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit, his body looked like it had been taken to the top of Everest and rolled down to sea level. By the time we reached Oakland, a social worker met us. He said, \u201cYour son is very sick \u2013 prepare yourself.\u201d \n Dr. Vivian Newman and her colleagues were in a flurry of activity over Jeff\u2019s purple body on the table. \n \u201c First we\u2019ll try to save his life, then we\u2019ll worry about saving limbs ,\u201d she told us. And then she said, \u201c We would like to try something experimental. We\u2019ve tried it once before. It has some risks and we would need informed consent. I would like our hematologist to discuss it with you .\u201d \n By the time I saw Jeff, the clotting DIC had already spread everywhere. He was purple with bruises from head to tail, except for the ends of his fingers and toes which were beginning to look like they where black with dying flesh. We were in big trouble. \n \u2018Yes, I know the risks ,\u201d I said. \u201c Do it .\u201d \n Dr. Singer, the hematologist, poked her head in and told me, \u201c we would like to try a thrombolytic agent .\u201d \n \u201c tPA?\u201d I asked. \n \u201c Yes ,\u201d she said. \u201c You know it? \u201d \n \u201c It\u2019s a Genentech product. I spent my sabbatical in the department where it is made .\u201d \n Tissue Plasminogen Activator is an enzyme that dissolves blood clots. \nFor the past three years I have been working with Genentech to develop a program to train technicians to manufacture this drug and others. In this program, we use tPA, or Activase, as a case study to represent how a typical biotech product comes to market. We discuss tPA\u2019s discovery, research and development, economics of production, marketing, effectiveness in treating the diseases for which it was approved, and the risks of using it. \n I had never heard about anyone using tPA to treat meningococcemia or DIC. No one at Genentech had either. It seemed at the time to be logical \u2013 that an enzyme that digests blood clots would be a good treatment for a boy who had blood clots choking all of his blood vessels, but the staff at Children\u2019s were pioneering this new application. \n The law on a new use for a drug is well-defined. The law wisely gives physicians wide discretion to use a drug in a way that isn\u2019t formally approved by the Food and Drug Administration, as long as they receive informed consent. In this case, tPA is approved to treat heart attack and stroke, where it digests the blood clots that block the coronary artery in the heart or the blood vessels in the brain. It made intellectual sense that an enzyme that digests blood clots could help Jeff, whose entire body was filled with blood clots. But would it work? \n \u201c Should we go ahead? \u201d Dr. Singer asked. \u201c There are risks .\u201d \n \u201c Yes, I know the risks ,\u201d I said. \u201c Do it .\u201d \n I calculated that they would be the same as the risks in administering tPA to stroke victims. If there are any small holes in the blood vessels in the brain, the patient dies from bleeding. With the tPA digesting blood clots, there are no clots to seal any hole. It was a bit worse in this case since all of the clotting in Jeff\u2019s body had used up all of the clotting factors. I calculated that the blood vessels in the brain of 4-year-old would be intact. \n A Medical Miracle \nThey gave him some platelets and blood, and then started the tPA infusion which would drip in over a 4-hour period. In a little while, the purple visibly had started to clear. The clearing wasn\u2019t instantaneous; it was more like clockwork. You couldn\u2019t see it clear, but if you looked away from his body, by the time you looked back, the color seemed lighter. A second four-hour treatment improved the condition even more. His brain blood vessels held, and there seemed to be no complications. \n Amputations are a big problem with this disease, since the clots that it produces cut off blood flow to the limbs. Several of the workers in Oakland\u2019s rehabilitation unit told me \u201cI\u2019ve had five or six kids who survived this, but I\u2019ve never seen one who didn\u2019t have at least one limb amputated. \n Many children lose all of their limbs. \nDr. Newman was watching Jeff\u2019s right leg. On day two she said, \u201c This limb is compromised .\u201d It was turning purple and cold. She ordered one last round of tPA. Although this third treatment didn\u2019t produce results quite as dramatic as the first two, it began to work immediately. The border of the purple area on the foot began to recede, and a star of white pushed into the area. \n The cold areas began to feel warmer. His leg was saved. I had prepared myself mentally that he would lose the fingers on his right hand and his right leg, at least below the knee. A medical miracle saved them. \n With life and limbs restored, the next question arose: \u201c Is there any brain damage? \u201d We would have to wait until they stopped the intravenous drugs and brought him around. A week on his back had caused fluid to pool in his lungs. They stopped the drugs, pulled out the respirator tubes, and began to suction out the fluids. In the middle of a suction treatment, Jeff opened his eyes, looked at the nurse, and said \u201c Stop it \u201d and \u201c do this to my brother .\u201d Since I believe that sibling rivalry represents higher brain function, I then knew that he would be all right. \n Jeff remains hospitalized, recuperating from some skin damage on his leg that the temporary loss of blood produced. These areas of skin damage will need grafting, and he has some muscle and neurological damage to his legs. \n Mentally he\u2019s as sharp as ever; sharp enough to correct me on my Pokemon misidentifications. It will take a bit of time and physical therapy to know how well he can heal \u2013 but I haven\u2019t forgotten where we were two months ago. \n A series of fortunate events all broke our way. We took him in. The bacterium wasn\u2019t an antibiotic resistant strain. The NorthBay emergency room staff recognized that the disease was serious enough to order an airlift. The staff at Oakland was familiar with tPA and willing to pioneer a new technique. That particular staff happened to be on duty. \n The drug they chose turned out to be the drug that I knew the most about, so I could give a quick approval. The helicopter pad had been closed and only recently reopened. And it all worked. \n No one knows how children get this killer bacterium. A significant number of people carry it in the back of their throats with no ill effect. For a reason that isn\u2019t clear, in a few it jumps into the bloodstream to cause this deadly disease. \n Until recently, the shock produced by this disease killed most of the children who contracted it. The blood clots of the DIC condition make it even worse. \n In his four decades of medical practice, my father-in-law had never seen a child with this condition survive. New developments in critical care techniques allow physicians to give the kids a fighting chance. \n The pioneering use of tPA by Oakland Children\u2019s\u2019 Hospital prevented disaster in this case. It isn\u2019t hyperbole to call this event a medical miracle. \n technorati tags: Bio-Link , biotechnology , Genentech , education , biotechnology education , tPA , meningococcemia"], "link": "http://scienceblogs.com/digitalbio/2011/05/06/its-all-about-aunt-millie/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://technorati.com/": 7, "http://secure.elabs7.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Discovering Biology in a Digital World"}]
