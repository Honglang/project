But as Jeff Leek explains, the criticism doesn't spawn from Silver being wrong. Rather, it comes from the critics' misunderstanding of statistics. Leek provides a quick lesson on how Silver makes his predications and how the methods apply to other things, like the weather. \n Now, this might seem like a goofy way to come up with a \"percent chance\" with simulated elections and all. But it turns out it is actually a pretty important thing to know and relevant to those of us on the East Coast right now. It turns out weather forecasts (and projected hurricane paths) are based on the same sort of thing \u2014 simulated versions of the weather are run and the \"percent chance of rain\" is the fraction of times it rains in a particular place. \n So Romney may still win and Obama may lose \u2014 and Silver may still get a lot of it right. But regardless, the approach taken by Silver is not based on politics, it is based on statistics. \n Don't fear the black box."], "link": "http://flowingdata.com/2012/10/31/a-quick-lesson-on-making-predictions/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.politico.com/blog": 1, "http://simplystatistics.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "FlowingData"}, {"content": ["The New York Times provides a detailed look at the Sandy aftermath , across states and locally.

The most dramatic change is shortly before the Downfall of N\u00famenor. The rulers are shown in order. Their number should not be confused with how many generations from Elros Aragorn is since there were more than one line of rulers. \n There's also a geographic map of where characters traveled, a family tree, a timeline, and even an Android app. I think Johansson might be a superfan.
