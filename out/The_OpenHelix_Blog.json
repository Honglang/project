There are several such resources ( Cytoscape , IntAct , MINT , STRING , VisANT , and one of my personal favorites GeneMania )\u00a0that OpenHelix has tutorials on (see our Pathway catalog listing). The IMP developers provide a nice amount of help for their users \u2013 not only do they have multiple YouTube videos (as do we on the OpenHelix YouTube channel ), but they also offer two interactive tutorials that allow users to be guided through an example usage of IMP. \n For today\u2019s tip I am featuring the third YouTube video that they list on their tutorial page , because I thought it had the best sound and image quality. The other videos are also informative & are worth a viewing \u2013 enjoy! \n Reference : \n Wong AK, Park CY, Greene CS, Bongo LA, Guan Y, & Troyanskaya OG (2012).

There are ways to look at predictions of binding, and for some species evidence of binding, and there are ways to look for binding motifs. But these resources vary in methods and scope, and it\u2019s not easy to obtain collected information about transcription factors in many species. \n One group has tried to change this, at least for animal transcription factors, with the AnimalTFDB. They collected and curated information about more than 70 families of TFs from 50 species, and created an interface where you can explore this collection by family, by species, and more. \n This was offered as one of the sources of information from a recent query at BioStar . The poster was looking specifically for non-model organism information, and this database was one of the suggestions. But you can explore that question for other details and suggestions too. \n The paper from the AnimalTFDB team provides information on other sources of TF information\u2013including bacteria, plants , and various types of related resources too. So if you are looking for non-animal details there could be some guidance for you in there. Some of these you might see in future tips! \n In the AnimalTFDB system itself, you\u2019ll find that you have multiple ways to explore the data. From the landing page you can quickly browse to the collected data by TF family, or move right to the data organized by species instead. But there is also a standard search option with a form-based query. You can refine your search in various ways with that search form. \n When you get to a transcription factor (or one of the other types that\u2019s curated, transcription co-factors and chromatin remodeling proteins) there will be links to many types of useful additional details. Transcripts, domains, GO terms, and links to multiple related resources and more. \n So if you are interested in transcription factors, co-factors, and chromatin remodeling proteins in animal species, check out AnimalTFDB. \n Quick link: \n AnimalTFDB: http://www.bioguo.org/AnimalTFDB/ \n Reference: \n Zhang, H.M., Chen, H., Liu, W., Liu, H., Gong, J., Wang, H. & Guo, A.Y.

I had something else planned, but as folks on Google+ last night were discovering and enjoying this new software, I decided to bring over this video on OneZoom, a new \u201ccool tool\u201d for exploration of the phylogenetic relationships of species. It\u2019s an interactive viewer for larger phylogenetic trees. \n This tool uses fractal strategies to enable users to zoom and scroll around the tree of life. You can quickly get a large overview, and then navigate down to precise and specific nodes on the tree. It\u2019s very slick. The first video gives you an overview of the project and the theory. A second video they call a tutorial offers more specifics on how to interact with the software. \n There are two reasons I\u2019m glad to see this: 1) we definitely need new visualization and organization strategies with all the \u201cbig data\u201d coming our way. And 2) they make that case that I keep making: \n Much of the difficulty with phylogenetic tree visualization (and with data visualization more generally) is that we all too often constrain ourselves to the \u201cpaper paradigm\u201d\u2014the practice of displaying data in ways that are optimized for printing on paper. \n Beyond the paper paradigm. Or, as I keep saying, the data is not in the papers anymore. It\u2019s in the software and you have to use the software tools to explore it and take it further. And often (as was the case with ENCODE) the data is available to you long before publication\u2013but unless you know the way in, you\u2019ll miss out on great opportunities by waiting for the papers to come out. \n In this case they assess the state of other phylogenetic visualizations as well. They describe what drove them to the solution they\u2019ve come to\u2013something like Google Earth for species evolutionary relationships. You can use the software to scroll around and zoom in, but there\u2019s also a search function to go right to places of interest. Currently there are over 5000 species of mammals, and their \u201ccoming soon\u201d section says 5000 amphibians are on the way. The goal by 2014 is approximately 2 million species. \n This second \u201ctutorial video\u201d gives more specifics on how to interact with the software: \n \n It is a very cool tool described on the community page at PLoS Biology. They say it\u2019s the first in a series of a new \u201cCool tools\u201d section. Excellent\u2013I love cool tools! It\u2019s a bit funny to me though that the YouTubes aren\u2019t embedded in the paper as figures. Go figure\u2026. \n From the Software page ( http://www.onezoom.org/software.htm ) you can access both the mammal tree, and a bacterial tree with over 400,000 species. And there you\u2019ll also see instructions for viewing your own data. \n I think it will be a very engaging educational tool. What\u2019s not as clear to me is if this will drive discovery and enable people to go further. Slick displays are great\u2013but they are always not enough to enable further work and analysis to ensue. That may be the case here, and their planned directions will also take it further. In the meantime, it\u2019s probably enough to have creationists minds blown\u2026heh. \n Quick links: \n OneZoom http://www.onezoom.org/ \n Follow them on twitter for updates: https://twitter.com/OneZoomTree @OneZoomTree \n Reference: \n Rosindell, J., & Harmon, L.
