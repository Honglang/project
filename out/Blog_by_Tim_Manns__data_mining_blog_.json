I've been *very* busy on many Data Mining Analytics projects in my role as a Data Mining Consultant for SAS. The content of my work is usually sensititive and therefore discussing it in any level of detail in public blog posts is difficult. This specific post is to help promote the launch of the new IAPA website and increase focus on Analytics in Australia (and Sydney, where I am normally based). The topic of this post is something that has been at the forefornt of my mind and seems to be a central theme of many of the projects I have been working on recently. It is certaininly a current problem for many Marketing/Customer Analytics departments. So here are a few thoughts and comments on 'big data'. Apologies for typos, it is mostly written piecemeal on my iPhone during short 5 mins breaks...  How big is too big (for Analytics)?  I frequently read Analytics blogs and e-magazines that talk about the 'new' explosion of big data. Although I am unconvinced it is new, or will improve anytime soon, I do agree that despite technology advances in analytics the growth of data generation and storage seems to be outpacing most Analyst's ability to transform data into information and utilize it to greater benefit (both operationally and analytically). The term 'Analysis Paralysis' has never been so relevant!   But from a practical perspective what conditions cause data to become unwieldy? For example, take a typical customer services based organisation such as a bank, telcom, or public dept: how can the data (de)-evolve to a state that makes it 'un-analysable' (what a horrible thought..). Even given mild (by today's standards) numbers of variables and records, certain practices and conditions can lead to bottlenecks, widespread performance problems, and delays that make any delivery of Analytics very challenging.   So, below is a series of my most recent observations from Analytics projects I have been involved with that involved resolving, or encountered 'big data' problems:   - Scaleable Infrastructure.  Data will grow. Fast. In fact it will probably more than double in the next few years. CPU capacity of data warehousing and analytics servers need to improve to match. As an example, I was working on a telcom Social Network Analysis project recently where we were processing weekly summaries of mobile telephone calls for approx 18million individuals. My role was to analysis the social interactions between all customers and build dozens of propensity scores, using the social influence of others to predict behaviour. In total I was probably processing hundreds of millions of records of data (by a dozen or so variables). This was more than the client typically analysed. After a week of design and preliminary work I began to conasider ways to optimise the performance of my queries and computations, and I asked about the server specifications. I assumed some big server with dozens of processors, but unfortunately what I was connecting to was a dual core 4GB desktop PC under an Analyst's desk...   - Variable Transformations  A common mistake by inexperienced data miners is to ignore or short-cut comprehensive data preparation steps. All data that involves analysis of people is certain to include unusual characteristics. One person's outlier is another's screw-up :) So, what is the best way to account for outliers, skewed distributions, poor data sparsity, or highly likely erreonous data features? Well an approach (that i am not keen on) taken by some is to apply several variable transformations indiscriminatly to all 'raw' variables and subsequentially let a variable selection process pick the best input variables for propensity modeling etc. When combined with data which represents transposed time series (so a variable represents a value in 'month1' the next variable the same value dimension in 'month2' etc) then this can easily generate in excess of 20,000 variables (by say 10 million customers...). It is true there are variable selection methods that handle 20,000 quite well, but the metadata and processing to create those datasets is often significant and the whole process often incurs excessive costs in terms of time to delivery of results. Additional problems that may arise when you start working with many thousands of variables is that variable naming needs to be easily understood and interpretable. The last thing a data miner wants to do is spend hours working out what those transformed and selected important variables in the propensity model actually mean and represent in the raw data. Which leads me to my next point..  - Variable / Data Understanding One of the core skills of a good data miner is the understanding and translate complex data in order to solve business problems. As organisations obtain more data it is not just about more records, often the data reveals new subtle operational details and customer behaviors not previously known, or completely new sources of data (FaceBook, social chat, location based services etc). This in turn often requires extended knowledge of the business and operational systems to enable the correct data warehouse values or variable manipulations and selections to be made. An analyst is expected to understand most parts of an organization's data at a level of detail most individuals in the organisation are not concerned with, and this is often a momental task. As an example of 'big data' bad practice, I've encountered verbose variables names which immediately require truncation (due to IT / variable name limit reasons), others which make understand the value or meaning of the variable difficult, or naming conventions which are undocumented. For example: \"number_of_broken_promises\" is one of the funniest long max variable names I've seen, whilst others such as \"ccxs_ytdspd_m1_pct\" can be guessed when you have the business context but definitely require detailed documentation or a key.  - Diverse Skillsets  'big data' often requires big warehouse and analytics systems (see point 1) and so an analyst must have understanding of how these systems work properly.  Through personal experience I'm always aware of table indexes on a Teradata system for example. By default the first column in a warehouse table will be the index, so if you incorrectly use a poorly managed or repetitive variable such as 'gender' or 'end_date' then the technology of a big data system works against you. I've seen this type of user error on temp tables or analytics output tables far too many times. Big Data often involves bringing information from a greater number of sources, so understanding the source systems and data warehouse involved is an important challenge.  I hope this helps. I strongly recommend getting involved with the IAPA and Sydney Data Miner's Meetup if you are based in Australia or Sydney.  - Tim"], "link": "http://timmanns.blogspot.com/feeds/6374061418711769600/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {}, "blogtitle": "Blog by Tim Manns (data mining blog)"}, {"content": ["Although not one of my favourites, I confess to owning the film \u2018Minority Report\u2019. Set a few decades in the future, there is a section of the film in which Tom Cruise walks through a shopping centre and is inundated with targeted offers to buy products and services sold in adjacent retail stores. Is this futuristic scenario really that distant? Of course in the film there are sinister eye scanners and creepy robot spiders to identify the individual instead of a near field device such as a smart phone (iPhone or Android), but the principal is the same (and lets ignore the issue of stolen identity for another discussion :) Many Android handsets now have near field communications (NFC) technology. According to some reputable sources ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-25/apple-plans-service-that-lets-iphone-users-pay-with-handsets.html ) the 5th generation of iPhone will also include near field communications (NFC) technology, which amongst other things can allow users to pay for goods and services just like they currently do with their credit card. Many iPhone users already buy songs and applications from iTunes, which has made it become a significant global billing platform, and provides a notable proportion of revenue for Apple (4.1% of its total quarterly earnings for Q1, see http://www.fiercemobilecontent.com/story/apples-itunes-revenues-top-11-billion-q1/2011-01-19) If iPhone, iPad and iPod users adopt widespread use of NFC for purchase of everyday groceries and general retail goods, then iTunes could quickly curve a huge slice out of the VISA and Mastercard revenue stream. The use of smart phone applications for communication (such as Facebook and Twitter) have already taken significant chunks out of telco\u2019s revenues from traditional voice communication. As smart devices and apps further empower users, telcos face the greater danger of becoming a dumb pipe. In my opinion there is the opportunity for NFC to enable telco\u2019s to develop a closer relationship with customers and act as the information conduit (rather than Google or Apple). With varying degrees of success, telco\u2019s currently perform a lot of data mining to understand usage patterns, household demographics, forecasting of network demand etc. Much of this analysis is marketing focused, with an objective to gain new customers, retain a customer, and/or spend more. Most importantly for data miners these marketing activities usually involve intelligently processing very large amounts of data. There are a lot of parallels with data mining performed by VISA and Mastercard, so you would think that telco\u2019s might have the infrastructure and experience to play in the area of credit cards. Some telcos are able to provide single billing, whereby the entire household has a single bill for multiple mobile services, wireless broadband, fixed/land telephony, cable TV etc. If a telco already has the rating system to charge for usage of high transaction telephony services, and also provide a single unified household billing platform, then incorporating the purchase of retail goods and a NFC system should not be a challenge for a telco. From my experience I\u2019ve not seen VISA or many retail banks offer a single bill for your household purchases, across multiple individuals and products. This capability places telco\u2019s head and shoulders above banks and credit card companies in the customer experience stakes. Most developed countries have 3G or better mobile networks, and when combined with smart phones can easily pin-point the location of a customer. If telco\u2019s used NFC to process and learn each customers (or household\u2019s) purchase habits and preferences, then there is no reason why they couldn\u2019t recommend products and offers for shopping centres or stores in your immediate vicinity in real-time. The additional revenue opportunities might even be able to cover the cost of moderate telephony usage, so customers could get a mobile plan subsidised by advertising and purchase revenue. For example, the telco would develop the trusted relationship with the customer, and many retailers could pay a commission to target specific customer segments, or individuals in the vicinity that buy similar products. Retailers wouldn\u2019t need to implement their own loyalty cards to identify customers, they could simply get summarised information about who shops at their stores, how often, share of wallet etc from the telco company that manages the relationship with the customer. I would relish the opportunity to analysis *that* kind of data!

I just finished a project and would like some feedback. I\u2019m trying to explain this as a data preparation and analysis approach to solve a specific problem. I\u2019ve described as best I could without names or actual data. I also did a lot of presentation and extra info for the segments not described here. If anyone has relevant words of wisdom, or suggestions for a different approach they would have taken, then please describe it! Otherwise, perhaps this will be helpful to others\u2026 The business problem to solve was generating customer insight (Businesses with loans), with considerations for each client business' financial health and business loan repayment risk. The first thing we concentrated on was tax payments. The data I had access to contained typical finance account monthly summaries (eg. balance at close of month, total $ of transactions etc) but also two years of detailed transactional history of all outgoing and inbound money transfers/payments (eg. including tax payments made by many thousands of businesses). We examined two years of summary data and also all transactions for only those money transfers/payments that involved the account number belonging to the tax man. The core idea was to understand each businesses tax payments over time in order to get an accurate view of their financial health. Obviously this would have great importance in predicting future loan repayments or likelihood of future financial problems. One main objective was to understand if tax payment behavior differed significantly between customers, and a secondary consideration was the risk profiles of any subgroups or segments that could be identified. It was a quick preliminary investigation (less than two weeks work) so I tackled the problem very simplistically to meet deadlines. For the majority of client businesses tax payments occur quarterly or monthly, so I first summarized the data to a quarterly aggregation, for example;   As you can see above, each customer could have many records (actually it was a maximum of 8, one for each quarter over a two year period), each record showing the account balance at the end of the quarter and the net sum of payments made to (or from!) the tax man. Then I created two offset copies of Tax Payments, one being the previous record (Lag) and the other being the subsequent record (Lead) like so;  I then simply scaled the data so that everything was between 0-1 by using; (X \u2013 (minimum of X)) / ((maximum of X) - (minimum of X)) Obviously, where X is one of the variables representing quarterly account balance or tax payments, and the maximum is within Customer ID. For example the raw data here;  Got rescaled to;  I did the all raw balance and tax payment variable rescaling this way so that I could later run a Pearson\u2019s correlation, and k-means clustering, and also graph data easily on the same axis (directly compare balance and tax payments). Some business customers had very large account balances, but small tax payments. For example I could eventually generate a line chart like this showing a specific business\u2019 relationship between balance (dotted line) and tax payments (bold red line);  I then ran a simple Pearson\u2019s correlation with the variable \u2018Balance\u2019 correlated against the 3 tax payment variables (original, lag , and lead) with a correlation Group By clause on the Customer ID. This would output three correlation scores, one for the original (account balance and tax payments in same month), second for the correlation between current account balance and previous month\u2019s tax payments, and the third for the current account balance and future month tax payments. My thought process was to use the highest correlation score (along with balance and tax payment amounts as described below) to build k-means clusters to segment the customer base. Hopefully the segments would reflect, amongst other things, the strongest relationship between account balance and tax payments. I joined the correlation outputs to the data and then I flipped/transposed and summarized the data so that each quarter was a new column for balance and tax payments, creating a very wide and summarized data set. For example;  \u2026also including the correlation, lag, lead and original value variables in the single record per customer\u2026 Now I have a dataset that is a nice single record per customer, and concentrated on representing the growth or decline in tax payments over the 2 year period. I did this quite simply by converting the raw payments into percentages (of the sum of each customer\u2019s payments over the two years). In some cases a high proportion of the customer\u2019s payments occurred many months ago, which represents a decline in recent quarters. I then built a K-means model using inputs such as; - the highest correlation score (of the three per customer) and categorical encoding of the correlations (eg. \u2018negative correlation\u2019 / \u2018positive correlation\u2019, \u2018lag\u2019 / \u2018lead\u2019 etc) - Data manipulated payment sums - Variables representing growth or decline in payments over time. The segments that were generated have proved to perform very well. Many features of the client business that were not used in the segmentation (eg number of accounts per client, and risk propensity) could be distinguished quite clearly by each segment. When I examined the incidence of risk (failure or problems repaying a business loan) for a three month period (also with a three month gap) I found some segments had almost double the risk propensity. Timeline described below;   As you can see, there were a very small number of risk outcomes (just 204 in three months) but each of these is very high value, so any lift in risk prediction is beneficial. I hate working with such small samples, but sometimes you get given lemons\u2026. Suppose I built five clusters, here\u2019s an example summary of the type of results I managed to get;  Where \u2018Risk Index\u2019 is simply calculated as; (\u2018% Of Total Risk\u2019 \u2013 \u2018% Of Client Count\u2019 ) / \u2018% Of Client Count\u2019 So, this is showing that cluster 5 has 67.91% higher propensity to be a bad risk that the entire base (well, in the analysis\u2026). Conversely cluster 2 is much less (-70%) likely to be a bad risk than the average customer. Maybe not your typical financial risk model\u2026.  \ufeff"], "link": "http://timmanns.blogspot.com/feeds/8261899303843831988/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://4.blogspot.com/": 3, "http://2.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://3.blogspot.com/": 2, "http://1.blogspot.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Blog by Tim Manns (data mining blog)"}, {"content": ["The Institute of Analytics Professionals of Australia (IAPA) requested I give a generic presentation next week on social network analysis and how it can be used for activities such as customer insights, marketing (acquisition, retention, up-sell), fraud detection etc. See their current newsletter; http://alerts.iapa.org.au/ or website; http://www.iapa.org.au/ I'll make the presentation as vendor neutral and informative as possible (but obviously I can't discuss details of any previous confidential work by myself or SAS).

The NetFlix prize was won by a conglomerate of various models and approaches that each excelled in subsets of the data. A number of data miners have presented findings based upon using simple ensembles that use the mean prediction of a number of models. I was surprised that some form of weighting isn\u2019t commonly used, and that a simple mean average of multiple models could yield such an improvement in the global predictive power. It kinda reminds me of Gestalt theory phrase \"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts\". It\u2019s got me thinking, when it is best not to share predictive power. What if one model is the best? There is also a ton of considerations regarding scalability and trade-off between additional processing , added business value, and practicality (don\u2019t mention random forests to me..), but we\u2019re pretend those don\u2019t exist for the purpose of this discussion :) So this has got me thinking do ensembles work best in situations where there are clearly different sub-populations of customers. For example Netflix is in the retail space, with many customers that rent the same popular blockbuster movies, and a moderate number of customers that rent rarer (or far more diverse, ie long tail) movies. I haven\u2019t looked at the Netflix data so I\u2019m guessing that most customers don\u2019t have hundreds of transactions, so generalising the correct behaviour of the masses to specific customers is important. Netflix data on any specific customer could be quite scant (in terms of rents/transactions). In other industries such as telecom, there are parallels; customers can also be differentiated by nature of communication (voice calls, sms calls, data consumption etc) just like types of movies. Telecom is mostly about quantity though (customer x used to make a lot of calls etc). More importantly there is a huge amount of data about each customer, often with many hundreds of transactions per customer. There is therefore relatively lesser reliance upon supporting behaviour of the masses (although it helps a lot) to understand any specific customer. Following this logic, I\u2019m thinking that ensembles are great at reducing the error of incorrectly applying insights derived from the generalised masses to those weirdos that rent obscure sci-fi movies! Combining models that explain sub-populations very well makes sense, but what if you don\u2019t have many sub-populations (or can identify and model their behaviour with one model). But you may shout \"hey what about the KDD Cup\". Yes, the recent KDD Cup challenge (anonymous featureless telecom data from Orange) was also a won by an ensemble of over thousand models created by IBM Research. I'd like to have had some information about what the hundreds of columns respresented, and this might have helped better understand the Orange data and build more insightful and performing models. Aren't ensemble models used in this way simply a brute force approach to over learn the data? I'd also really like to know how the performance of the winning entry tracks over the suebsequent months for Orange. Well, I haven\u2019t had a lot of success in using ensemble models in the telecom data I work with, and I\u2019m hoping it is more a reflection of the data than any ineptitude on my part. I\u2019ve tried simply building multiple models on the entire dataset and averaging the scores, but this doesn\u2019t generate much additional improvement (granted on already good models, and I already combine K-means and Neural Nets on the whole base). During my free time I\u2019m just starting to try splitting the entire customer base into dozens of small sub-populations and building a Neural Net model on each, then combining the results and seeing if that yields an improvement.

I think my presentations went down well (well, I got good feedback). There were also a few questions and issues that were posed to me. One issue raised by Dean Abbott was regarding building neural networks on unbalanced data in Clementine. Rightly so, Dean pointed out that the building of neurals nets can actually work perfectly fine against unbalanced data. The problem is that when the Neural Net determines a categorical outcome it must know the incidence (probability) of that outcome. By default Clementine will simply take the output neuron values, and if the value is above 0.5 the prediction will be true, else if the output neuron value is below 0.5 the category outcome will be false. This is why in Clementine you need to balance categorical outcome to roughtly 50%/50% when you build the neural net model. In the case of multiple categorical values it is the highest output neuron value which becomes the prediction. But there is a simple solution! It is something I have always done out of habit because it has proved to generate better models, and I find a decimal score more useful. Being a cautous individual (and at the time a bit jet lagged) I wanted to double check first, but simply by converting a categorical outcome into a numeric range you will avoid this problem. In situations where you have a binary categorical outcome (say, churn yes/no, or response yes/no etc) then in Clementine you can use a Derive (flag) node to create alternative outcome values. In a Derive (flag) node simply change the true outcome to 1.0 and the false outcome to 0.0. By changing the categorical outcome values to a decimal range outcome between 0.0 and 1.0, the Neural Network model will instead expose the output neuron values and the Clementine output score will be a decimal range from 0.0 to 1.0. The distribution of this score should also closely match the probability of the data input into the model during building. In my analysis I cannot use all the data because I have too many records, but I often build models on fairly unbalanced data and simply use the score sorted / ranked to determine which customers to contact first. I subsequently use the lift metric and the incidence of actual outcomes in sub-populations of predicted high scoring customers. I rarely try to create a categorical 'true' or 'false' outcome, so didn't give it much thought until now. If you want to create an incidence matrix that simply shows how many 'true' or false' outcomes the model achieves, then instead of using the Neural Net score of 0.5 to determine the true or false outcome, you simply use the probabilty of the outcome used to build the model. For example, if I *build* my neural net using data balanced as 250,000 false outcomes and 10,000 true outcomes, then my cut-off neural network score should be 0.04. If my neural network score exceeds 0.04 then I predict true, else if my neural network score is below 0.04 then I predict false. A simple derive node can be used to do this. If you have a categorical output with multiple values (say, 5 products, or 7 spend bands etc) then you can use a Set-To-Flag node in a similar way to create many new fields, each with a value of either 0.0 or 1.0. Make *all* new set-to-flag fields outputs and the Neural Network will create a decimal score for each output field. This is essential exposing the raw output neuron values, which you can then use in many ways similar to above (or use all output scores in a rough 'fuzzy' logic way as I have in the past:).

Data Mining within each industry is different, and even within the telecommunications industry definitions of churn are inconsistent. This often makes reported outcomes tricky to fully understand. I decided to post some churn model outcomes after reading a post by the enigmatic Zyxo on his (or maybe her :)) blog ; http://zyxo.wordpress.com/2009/08/29/data-mining-for-marketing-campaigns-interpretation-of-lift/ I'd like to know if the models rate well :) I'd love to see reports of the performance of any predictive classification models (anything like churn models) you've been working on, but I realise that is unlikely... For like-minded data miners a simple lift chart might suffice. The availability of data will greatly influence your ability to identify and predict churn (for the purpose of this post churn is defined as when good fare paying customers voluntarily leave). In this case churn outcome incidence is approx 0.5% per month, where the total population shown in each chart is a few million. Below are two pictures of recent churn model Lift charts I built. Both models use the previous three months call summary data and the previous month's social group analysis data to predict a churn event occurring in the subsequent month. Models are validated against real unseen historical data. I'm assuming you know what a lift chart is. Basically, it shows the magnitude increase in the proportions of your target outcome (in this case churn) within small sub-groups of your total population. Sub-groups are rank/sorted by propensity. For example, in the first chart we obtain 10 times more churn in the top 1% of our customers we suspected of churning using the predictive model. The first model is built for a customer base of prepaid (purchase recharge credit prior to use) mobile customers, where the main sources of data are usage and social network analysis. The second model is postpaid (usage is subsequently billed to customer) mobile customers, where contract information and billing are additionally available. Obviously contracts commit customers for specified periods of time, so act as very 'predictive' inputs for any model. - first churn model lift  - second churn model lift  Both charts show our model lift in blue and the best possible result in dotted red. For the first model we are obtaining a lift of approximately 6 or 7 for the top 5% population (where the best possibly outcome would be 20 (eg. (100 / 5) = 20). The second model is significantly better, with our model able to obtain a lift of approximately 10 for the top 5% of population (half way to perfection :) I mention lift at 5% population because this gives us the reasonable mailing size and catches a large number of subsequent churners. Obviously I can't discuss the analysis itself in any depth. I'm just curious what the first impressions are of the lift. I think its good, but I could be delusional! And just to confirm, it is real and validated against unseen data. - enjoy!"], "link": "http://timmanns.blogspot.com/feeds/8047148861904054696/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://2.blogspot.com/": 2, "http://zyxo.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Blog by Tim Manns (data mining blog)"}, {"content": ["Over the years I have purchased a few data mining, machine learning, and even statistics books. I'll confess that I haven't read every book page by page, in fact some I've speed-read hoping to catch some interesting highlights. Below is a summary and short review of the books that are sitting on my desk at work...   - from left to right; - Marketing Calculator (author Guy Powell) I got a free copy because I contributed to some of the industry examples. I'm even quoted in it! I found the book very useful and would recommend it for any marketing analyst. It talks about ROI and measuring every type of marketing event and customer interaction. Lots of case studies, which I always like. No detail in terms of data analysis itself, but plenty of food for ideas. - Advances In Knowledge Discovery And Data Mining (editors Usama Fayyad, Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, Padhraic Smyth, Ramasamy Uthurusamy) I first bought this for Rakesh Agrawal's article on Association Rules (Apriori in Clementine), but also found John Elder's Statistical Perspective on Knowledge Discovery very informative. It provides a great concise history of data mining. - Data Mining Using SAS Applications (author George Fernandez) I bought this hoping to get a different opinion or learn something new (compared to the SPSS Clementine User Guide I have far too much experience of..). I thought; maybe SAS analysts had a better way to do a specific type of data handling or followed a alternative thought pattern to accomplish a goal. Sadly I was disappointed. Like many data mining books it spend hundreds of pages describing algorithms and expert options for refining your model building and less than 10 pages on data transformations and/or data cleaning. Those 10 pages are well written though. Not worth the purchase in my view. I only hope SAS analysts have better books out there. - Data Mining Techniques (authors Micheal Berry and Gordon Linoff) Written by practitioners means a lot. The one book I often re-read just in case I missed something the previous time :) Maybe because it is very applicable to my role as an analyst in a marketing dept in a telecommunications carrier, but I find this book invaluable. Lots of case studies. 100 pages of background and practical tips before it even reaches 'algorithms' is good in my view, and when do you reach the algorithms they are described in practical terms as techniques very well (rather than a laborious stats class, and I didn't do stats at University). I find the whole book a joy to read. A must for every data miner. - Data Mining. A Tutorial Based Primer (authors Richard Roger and Micheal Geatz) Whilst going through a phase of keen hobby programming in VB.NET I tried my hand at writing a neural net, decision tree etc from scratch. I found this book really helpful since it goes through every detail a programmer would need to implement their own data mining code in Excel. I work with huge amounts of data, so the thought of doing data mining in Excel makes my giggle (maybe that's a bad thing...) but the principals of data manipulation, cleaning and prediction etc can easily be applied in Excel. If you really want to understand how algorithms work and build your own, then this book is very useful for that purpose. - Data Mining. Introductory and Advanced Topics If you did spend several years studying mathematics or statistics then this book would probably act as a great reference and reminder of how algorithms work. Its very academic and sometimes that's useful. I think there's one line in there somewhere that mentions data cleaning or data transformations as being an industry thing... It is also quite a hard heavy book, so could be useful to rest stuff on. - Data Mining. Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques (Ian Witten and Eibe Frank) This is a classic example of bait advertising that some authors should be jailed for. On page 52 of this book the authors write; \"Preparing input for a data mining investigation usually consumes the bulk of the effort invested in the entire data mining process. Although this book is not really about the problems of data preparation, we want to give you a feeling for the issues involved....\" Fuck me, its not a data mining book then is it? Not only that, they actually use the term \"Practical\" in the title. Clearly it is not practical at all if it involves absolutely zero data manipulation. If I ever meet one of these authors I will slap them in the face and demand my money back... Oh and over half the book is a damn Weka user guide. - The Elements Of Statistical Learning. Data Mining, Inference and Prediction (authors Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman) Very heavy on the stats and squiggly equations (which take me ages to make sense of) but quite well written because I usually manage to understand it. Explains the algorithms stuff very well. I don't refer to it much and only read a few chapters in depth, but it was worth the purchase. - The Science Of Superheroes (authors Lois Gresh and Robert Weinberg). Not everything is about data mining. There's a whole world out there, and just maybe it includes super heroes with laser beams shooting out of their eyes. Its a soft-core science book discussing concepts such as; faster than light speed, cosmic rays, genetically engineered hulks, flying without wings, and black holes and how it all relates to real-life superheroes (if they existed). Really good geeky material. - Data Preparation For Data Mining (author Dorian Pyle) A good book, and like \"Data Mining Techniques\" it clearly covers topics with a practical understanding (no 'real-world' case studies though). Where it differs is that this book has a stronger academic or statistics focus. I didn't get a sense that the examples would always relate to large real-world data sets, and many methods I use were not mentioned at all (for example frequency binning) because they have no statistical basis. Here's the problem; this is a great data mining book, but only for the statistics in practical data mining. It is a book I frequently refer to and would recommend, although I'd like to see stuff added that *isn't* based on statistics. - The Essence Of Databases (author F. Rolland) 101 database for dummies. It describes database schemas, relational concepts, tons of SQL examples for queries and data transformations, describes object oriented databases etc. Essential stuff for anyone querying a corporate data warehouse. It reads easily and is recommended. - Data Mining. Concepts, Models, Methods, and Algorithms (author Mehmed Kantardzic) Another 'list all the algorithms I know' book. I'll be honest; I only quickly flicked through it hoping to see some case studies or something new. It seemed good, but didn't seem to have anything to set it apart from any other algorithms book. - Statistics Explained. Basic concepts and methods. ( authors R. Fapadia and G. Andersson) Just in case I forget what a t-test is. Has lots of pictures :) - Clementine User Guides (author: many at SPSS, well if memory serves me Clay Helberg did a fair chunk of it) . When I was at SPSS I had a small part to play in these. I provided some examples and proof read where possible. I've been using Clementine daily for over a decade, but still refer to the user guide occasionally. I find them useful, but they could benefit from some new examples to take advantage of the many new features that have been added in recent years. - Enjoy!"], "link": "http://timmanns.blogspot.com/feeds/3174987207595140821/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://3.blogspot.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Blog by Tim Manns (data mining blog)"}, {"content": ["Quick post because I'm swamped with work...

I do not represent any organisation. This is a personal blog and I talk freely about data mining from a personal perspective only. -- See a recent news article; http://www.itwire.com/content/view/24786/1095/ And also; http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25414690-15306,00.html As a Data Miner for a telecommunications provider I frequently use network data in my analysis. How many calls the customer makes, at what time of day, do they communicate using voice or sms etc. I examine data pertaining to *customers* only. Telecommunications companies often provision services wholesale for another company. This 'wholesale recipient' company will pay for the use of the network, but manage all other activities such as marketing, customer account and billing. In these cases, although the telecommunications company is responsible for supplying the network service and ensuring calls are successfully established (and likely stores data about these calls), it doesn't own the call data for that customer (who belongs to the 'wholesale recipient' company). Make sense? Use of the data that pertains to the actions of someone that is not a customer of that telecommunications company must be treated with the utmost caution. Every data miner must be aware of data privacy laws, and in many countries failure to adhere to these laws attract heavy financial penalties for the organisation and individuals involved. In Australia some invasion of privacy laws could even potentially involve 2 years jail time. Recently Telstra, an Australia telecommunication company (and the previous incumbent) was found guilty of serious breaches of data privacy. For the 130 page publicly accessible transcript see; http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/422.html I guessing that the significant legal costs and years it has taken to get this result is obviously prohibitive for many telcos, so they let it slide. Optus didn't. Basically, the bit that caught my eye was on item 108 (yes, I speed read the whole thing...). It is legal jargon and reads; \"Telstra asserted that total traffic travelling across its network belonged to Telstra. Optus submitted that whether it belonged to Telstra is not the question posed by cl 15.1 of the Access Agreement. The question under cl 15.1 is whether Telstra owed an obligation under that clause with respect to traffic information recorded by Telstra of communications by Optus customers on the Telstra network because that information was Confidential Information of Optus. The definition of Confidential Information identifies what is the Confidential Information of Optus. Once a CCR records information in relation to a call made by an Optus customer, that information becomes the Confidential Information of Optus because it falls within the definition of \u2018Confidential Information\u2019. \" The first sentence is shocking. In English it basically suggests that Telstra treat all network calling data as its own, and freely uses call information made by anyone on that network as it sees fit. That includes calls made by customers of wholesale or competitors companies on their network. In the case of wholesale for fixed line (land) networks Telstra will know the address and likely also the name of the customer. In the early days Optus had little choice but to use some of Telstra's fixed line infrastructure, often the last bits of copper wire that reach a household. The information of this usage was passed to Executive and board members so that they knew customer size and market share by age, geography etc. It is also highly likely (although difficult to prove) that the Telstra retail arm used the data for marketing activities and actioned direct communications to that customer. Anti-competitive to say the least... One of the short conclusions of the legal findings were; \"For the foregoing reasons, I find that Telstra has used traffic information of Optus, or Communication Information of Optus for the purposes of the Access Agreement, both in the preparation of market share reports and in distributing those reports among Telstra personnel. I also find that such information is Confidential Information of Optus for the purposes of the Access Agreement, or is otherwise subject to the requirements of confidentiality in cl 15 of the Access Agreement, by force of cl 10 of that agreement. I also find that neither such use of such information nor its disclosure for such purposes is permitted by the Access Agreement.\" I guess the information here is probably too much in the 'telco land', but hopefully its clear enough to understand the gravity of this. I've known this type of stuff was being conducted by some telco's for a long time, but I'm shocked it was so brazen. Knowing the big differences between what we (as Data Miners) are 'able to do' regarding insights and personal information (particularly in mobile telecommunications) and what we 'should do' is very important. Years ago the industry passed the early developmental stage of storing data, in recent years we have learned how to understand the data and convert it into useful insights. I still think that many data miners don't realise how important (now more than ever before) it is that we act responsibility in the use of the personal information we obtain from 'our' data."], "link": "http://timmanns.blogspot.com/feeds/437952389531007532/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.com.au/": 1, "http://www.edu.au/": 1, "http://www.itwire.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Blog by Tim Manns (data mining blog)"}, {"content": ["If you work in a Marketing or Sales department then you probably have the challenging task of convincing your less technical colleagues of the benefit of using your awesome customer insights.

For more info see; http://www.kddcup-orange.com/index.php I am not able to download the data at work (security / download limits), so I might have to try this at home. I haven't even seen the data yet. I'm hoping its transactional cdr's and not in some summarised form (which it sounds like it is). I don't have a lot of free time so I might not get around to submitting an entry, but if I do these are some of the data preparation steps and issues I'd consider; - handle outliers If the data is real-world then you can guarantee that some values will be at least a thousand times bigger than anything else. Log might not work, so try trimmed mean or frequency binning as a method to remove outliers. - missing values The KDD guide suggests that missing or undetermined values were converted into zero. Consider changing this. Many algorithms will treat zero very differently from a null. You might get better results by treating these zero's as nulls. - percentage comparisons If a customer can make a voice or sms call, what's the percentage between them? ( eg 30% voice vs 70% sms calls). If only voice calls, then consider splitting by time of day or peak vs offpeak as percentages. The use of percentages helps remove differences of scale between high and low quantity customers. If telephony usage covers a number of days or weeks, then consider a similar metric that shows increased or decreased usage over time. - social networking analysis If the data is raw transactional cdr's (call detail records) then give a lot of consideration do performing a basic social networking analysis. Even if all you can manage is to identify a circle of friends for each customer, then this may have a big impact upon identification of high churn individuals or up-sell opportunities. - not all churn is equal Rank customers by usage and scale the rank to a zero (low) to 1.0 score (high rank). No telco should still be treating every churn as a equal loss. Its not! The loss of a highly valuable customer (high rank) is worse than a low spend customer (low rank). Develop a model to handle this and argue your reasons for why treating all churn the same is a fool's folly. This is difficult if you have no spend information or history of usage over multiple billing cycles.

I won't name the vendor, you can probably work it out. A significant part of the vendor solution is the ability to manage many, we're talking hundreds, of data mining models (predictive, clustering etc). In my group we do not have many data mining models, maybe a dozen, that we run on a weekly or monthly basis. Each model is quite comprehensive and will score the entire customer base (or near to it) for a specific outcome (churn, up-sell, cross-sell, acquisition , inactivity, credit risk, etc). We can subsequently select sub-populations from the customer base for targetted communications based upon the score or outcome of any single or a combination of models, or any criteria take from customer information. I'm not entirely sure why you would want hundreds of models in a Telco (or similar) space. Any selection criteria applied to specific customers (say, by age, or gender, or state, or spend) before modeling will ofcourse force a baised sample that feeds into the model and affects its inherant nature. Once this type of selective sampling is performed you can't easily track the corresponding model over time *if* the sampled sub-population ever changes (which is likely because people do get older, move house, or change spend etc). For this reason I can't understand why someone would want or have many models. It makes perfect sense in Retail (for example a model for each product or associations rules for product recommendations), but not many models that apply to sub-populations of your customer base.

You can view my example at; http://www.kdkeys.net/forums/thread/6495.aspx and download the source code, executable and example PMML directly from here; http://www.kdkeys.net/forums/6495/PostAttachment.aspx I can't post images as comments on Gordon's blog so below are two snapshots of the simple UI application that displays the Neural Net PMML graphic. a) graphic  b) PMML loaded into data grids  Cheers - Tim"], "link": "http://timmanns.blogspot.com/feeds/8154767923488147662/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://2.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://3.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.kdkeys.net/": 2, "http://www.data-miners.com/blog": 1}, "blogtitle": "Blog by Tim Manns (data mining blog)"}]
