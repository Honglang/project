I was wondering if there were any weakenings of the axioms of group that also allowed a complete classification of the simple objects. (Here, I mean no nontrivial quotients.) Surprisingly, there\u2019s a classification for semigroups. In the theory of semigropus the term \u201cSimple& is used for a weaker notion. Semigroups with no nontrivial quotients are known as \u201ccongruence-free\u201d. The classification of finite congruence-free semigroups splits into two cases: for semigroups with a zero (an element 0 such that 0x = 0 ) there\u2019s an explicit construction, while a congruence-free semigroup without a zero must be a simple group. \n Another direction to generalize is weaken the form of associativity. The most-studied weakening is the Moufang property, which includes the octonions as a non-trivial example. Here, the complete classification is also known: a finite simple Moufang loop is either a group or a Paige loop, which is a non-associative construction closely related to the octonions, but defined over a finite field. It\u2019s interesting that in this case, the one non-associative family resembles simple groups of Lie type, in that it\u2019s parameterized by the finite fields. This classification relies non-trivially on the classification of simple groups, in that the explicit classification is used to rule out any other non-associative examples. \n The paper Octonions, simple Moufang loops and triality by G\u00e1bor Nagy and Petr Vojtechovsk\u00fd, explains Moufang loops, and how the classification of non-associative Moufang Loops reduces to a question about finite simple groups."], "link": "http://www.arsmathematica.net/archives/2012/04/25/classification-of-finite-simple-semigroups-and-moufang-loops/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://en.wikipedia.org/": 2, "http://www.quasigroups.eu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Ars Mathematica"}, {"content": ["I\u2019ve been trying to learn about stacks, something that is much easier in the Internet age.
