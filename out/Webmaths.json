I call for attention when they are seated. The room quietens (thanks to months of building up a good working relationship with these great kids) but X and Y continue their banter. \n I introduce today\u2019s \u201cLearning Intention\u201d \u2013 What is Pi ? \n My lesson plan includes some video clips and then outside with string and chalk to \u201cdraw\u201d some circles on the asphalt. The sun is now out and the day is starting to warm up. The students are enjoying a break from the four walls of the classroom and soon lots of yellow circles start to appear on the ground. \n Students use their feet as measuring instruments. Each circle radius is recorded and doubled to make the diameter. Then carefully feet are placed end on end around the circumference. \n Back in the classroom to calculate Circumference divided by Diameter. One boy proudly brings his book up to show me he has got pi equal to 3.16 ! I get student X to staple pi to 100 decimal places on the wall of the classroom. \n I then ask the class to use their calculators to complete my prepared worksheet (shown below), which involves converting historical attempts at finding fractions equal or close to the value of pi. \n  \n To my surprise, even my best students have trouble with question 3:\u00a0Which fraction is the best approximation for Pi? \n Perhaps my next lesson should be on decimals and place value???????"], "link": "http://webmaths.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/pi-and-place-value/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://webmaths.wordpress.com/": 5}, "blogtitle": "Webmaths"}, {"content": ["Recently, Pasi Sahlberg (Director General of Education in Finland ) was interviewed by Emma Alberici on ABC\u2019s Lateline . \n  \n Finland occupies the number one spot as far as the OECD testing standard is concerned.

As a puzzle solver, I find them both relaxing and motivating. To reach that final solution gives the solver a clear sense of purpose and a sense of satisfaction when the goal is achieved. \n Carefully chosen puzzles can also help students consolidate their arithmetic and problem solving skills. For example Sudoku puzzles do not require any arithmetic while Ken-Ken or Kakuro do. \n How the puzzles are used is also important. With Kakuro for example, I have scrounged some number tiles from other games to turn it in to a hands on puzzle. This makes it much more accessible to novice solvers who can use a \u201ctrial and error\u201d approach.

Students are motivated by the game format. \n 2. Champion or Most Improved (using multiplying factor) winning categories are seen as achievable by all or most students. \n 3. Students pay careful attention to solutions to see if their solution is correct and hence they can add on points. \n I introduced the rule that you must gamble a minimum of 5 points on each question. It soon became evident that some students were high risk players, others were very conservative. By question 5, one student lost all their points and begged to be allowed to borrow points from a friend! \n By question 9 excitement was building. Bruce was well in the lead, then forgot to collect like terms! His explosion had now bought other players into a winning position. Kate looked to be the likely winner until she factorized x 2 \u2013 5x \u2013 104 to equal (x + 13)(x \u2013 8).
