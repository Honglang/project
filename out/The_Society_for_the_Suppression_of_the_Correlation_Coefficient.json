Winsor was an important influence\u00a0on Tukey and best known in statistics for the form of sample of trimming known as winsorising . \n The aim of this blog is to further the aims of the society and educate about the dangers of unfettered application of the correlation coefficient. I like to think that this follows the spirit of the original informal society by spreading a serious message in a gently humourous way. \n References \n Tukey, J. W. (1954).
