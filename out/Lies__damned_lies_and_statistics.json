[{"blogurl": "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com\n", "blogroll": ["http://thestatsblog.wordpress.com"], "title": "Lies, damned lies and statistics"}, {"content": ["Every so often someone comes out with a study that tries to make the point that investing in social media is a waste of time as it won\u2019t help you sell your stuff. \n The latest incarnation is from Forrester (via Business Insider ) analyst Sucharita Mulpuru, who says that less than 1% of online transactions could be traced to a social media post. \n I\u2019ll respond in two ways: \n That\u2019s one study, here are five that show the opposite \nFirst of all the Forrester research is wildly counter-intuitive. The simple fact of the matter is we do pay attention to consumer opinions online. \n Exhibit A \u2013 Tripadvisor and Amazon. If social media had no affect on sales why do hoteliers and authors get so anxious about what\u2019s written about them to the extent of (in a few extreme cases) trying to stuff them with fake reviews ? A review site like Tripadvisor is popular precisely because consumers consult it *before* a sale. \n 1- In fact, according to Nielsen , which conducted a global study of 28,000 consumers in 56 countries, online consumer recommendations are the second most powerful source of \u2018brand advertising\u2019 ahead of even editorial endorsements. \n Number one was word of mouth endorsement from friends and family which of course sometimes also happen online. \n That\u2019s one (fairly persuasive) study that shows the opposite of Sucharita Mulpuru\u2019s report. Here are four more: \n 2 \u2013 15% of US social media purchasers have bought alcohol due to content they read on a social media site . However the same study by ROI research found that this can increase significantly if that content is about more than just promotions, ad messages and discounts. \n For example, Constellation Brands, which has 1.3 million Facebook fans, says 36% have purchased more because of social media. \n 3 \u2013 Constellation Brands raises a key point, it\u2019s about creating a community of advocates who do ultimately buy. According to Bain and co consumers active on social media spend 20-40% more with companies they engage with online than other customers. \n 4 \u2013 And those advocates in turn will persuade other consumers to buy. A comblu study says that super-fans and advocates are 50% more likely to create content that results in purchases \n 5 \u2013 Finally, that positive content and sentiment created by fans is important as social media can certainly work in reverse and harm sales. According to the Convergys Group, a single bad tweet or Facebook comment can cost you 30 customers. \n Social media isn\u2019t direct mail \nThose statistics I outline above all make a single point \u2013 people can create positive sentiment around your brand. That sentiment spreads thanks to online tools. And that sentiment then creates the right mood music for people to buy your products. \n However, social media by and large is not a direct response tool, and in that sense the Forrester report is correct. Social media is about everyday human interactions, and human interactions don\u2019t work like that. \n I wouldn\u2019t post a Facebook update or send out a tweet along the lines of \u201chey everyone, click on this link for the new Singer pilsner. It\u2019s refreshing and low calorie too!\u201d \n People don\u2019t do it because its crass, you wouldn\u2019t talk like that in real life and so its a sure- fire way to lose friends online. Yet the impetus is sometimes for social media to operate in this fashion, and so sadly some brands talk like that online. No wonder it doesn\u2019t always work as intended. \n As a result, I think Sucharita Mulpuru\u2019s study has done us all a favour. \n No, social media isn\u2019t comparable to direct mail. And no, I won\u2019t click on a link a friend has sent me to buy a new TV or lawnmower. \n However, next time I am browsing in store or online, the chances are when having to choose, I\u2019ll remember him / her raving about it, and I\u2019ll get out my credit card. \n Image \u2013 Michael Holden"], "link":

out with figures to show that, in the US at least, Instagram had 7.3 million daily active users (DAUs) beating Twitter\u2019s 6.9 million. \n That\u2019s very significant.\u00a0 Remember that as recently as last Christmas Instagram only had 16 million users, while at SXSW in March, it passed the 25 million total. \n Looking at it over the course of the whole month, Twitter beat Instagram with 29 vs 22 million DAUs. \u00a0 However, Twitter is of course still 5x the size of Instagram, with c.500 million accounts . \n On Twitter , RAAK\u2019s Wessel van Rensburg commented that Twitter has a problem if Instagram is approaching it in size on mobile devices, as they share a lot of similarities from hashtags to loose connections. \u00a0On that point, the real story isn\u2019t even so much the user numbers. \u00a0 It is the fact that while only c.30% of Twitter\u2019s user base is truly active , Instagram has managed to keep users engaged as the network has grown. \n Back in March at SXSW, Instagram boss Kevin Systrom claimed that 2/3 of users had logged in the previous day. \u00a0 I assumed that those numbers would change for the worse. \n However, Comscore tells us that the average Instagram user spent 257 minutes on the network over August, compared to 170 minutes for the average Twitter user who accessed it via a mobile. \n Or to put it another way, Instagram users spend 51% more time with the service than (mobile) Twitter users. \u00a0A big difference in engagement. \u00a0Certainly these stats imply something that I\u2019ve picked up from personal experience and observation: \u00a0That when it comes to people who aren\u2019t otherwise heavy users of social media, Instagram is doing a lot better at reeling them in. \n ( Above, chart of the day from

The IPC, the body which runs the Paralympic Games , has now produced a list of stats , which shows how the Paralympics similarly benefitted from social media exposure. \n I\u2019ve taken a few highlights from the news release they issued this afternoon, and added a few comments and supplementary figures onto them: \n 1 \u2013 Nearly 2 million people visited www.paralympic.org , the official website of the IPC.\u00a0 One in six visitors came from the UK, with USA, Germany, Poland and Canada making up the top five visiting countries \n 2 \u2013 There were close to 9 million views of videos featuring London 2012 sporting action or ceremonies uploaded to www.youtube.com/paralympicsporttv \n 3 \u2013 The IPC\u2019s official Facebook group www.facebook.com/ParalympicGames grew by 130% during the Games and now has over 136,000 likes \n 4 \u2013 Over 10 million unique users visited london2012.com more than 25 million times during the Paralympics and a further 5.8 million people upgraded their London 2012 App to the Paralympic version \n 5 \u2013 Individual athletes also benefitted: Great Britain\u2019s 100m T44 gold medallist Johnnie Peacock saw his Facebook fan page grow by 3,258% during 12 days of competition. \u00a0 Meanwhile South African Oscar Pistorius added 30,000 followers during the games \n 6 \u2013 Google released figures today claiming 100 million regular Google+ visitors, which produced a fair amount of head scratching. \u00a0 The IPC Google+ page was however certainly well received , getting 50,000 followers \n 7 \u2013 There have been 350,000 views of 600 behind the scenes videos produced by athletes as part of a Samsung sponsorship.\u00a0 \u00a0 As an aside, this is one of the better commercial tie-ins I saw during London 2012 and is worth checking out\u00a0 \n 8 \u2013 On August 25th, the IPC\u2019s official Twitter feed had 28,509 followers, on 10 September (the day after the games finished) it had 39,839. \n 9 \u2013 The UK Paralympics team saw an even greater increase with Twitter followers increasing from\u00a0 70,239 to 108,309 during the same period \n 10 \u2013 Finally during the games itself, Nielsen told us that a staggering 12% of UK social media messages were about the Paralympics \n As I posted on my Olympics Jux site, I was simply blown away by the Paralympics and the stats above prove I certainly wasn\u2019t alone. \u00a0\u00a0The online element of the games was particularly important given that US London2012 broadcaster NBC gave the Paralympics no live coverage at all , which puts the strong traffic figures from the US to the IPC website (which streamed live video) into perspective. \n \n Image \u2013 Greenwich Equestrian 2012 venue \n Related articles \n \n  \u2018London 2012.

A shame given the 227 US Paralympians representing their country. \n But as a result I must have appeared like people I occasionally see tweeting non stop about college football or major league baseball, where I wonder what on earth they are on about \u2013 and more to the point where I think \u2018what\u2019s this got to do with me?\u2019 \n I have seen two positives though. \n First of all I\u2019m now far more informed about my local area, Greenwich (London), than I was previously. \n Fairly soon into my Olympic tweeting I attracted the attention of local activists who objected to Greenwich Park being used for equestrian events, and from there I actually started tapping into a whole range of local twitter users. \n Never mind social media linking me to people half way around the world, using social media differently has connected me more to my immediate community. \n Related to that, I now follow a different mix of people. \u00a0The social media experts are still there. \u00a0So are plenty of people in sports, the Paralympic movement, and quite simply other Olympic / Paralympic enthusiasts from all walks of life. \n The range of content I see in my stream is different and more varied, and I think I\u2019m better off for it. \n It\u2019s benefitted me personally, I feel more optimistic and grounded with the real world. \u00a0As an aside I\u2019ve also been able to personally test out a few other social networks with my paralympic content like Jux and Eyeem . \n It\u2019s not rocket science, but its a reminder that\u2019s been said many times elsewhere, that those of us in agencies can easily start living in a bubble. \n In fact, I was reminded of something I posted a few years ago, a Dutch marketer, Martijn van Osch,\u00a0 who rationed his media intake to the bare minimum and \u2013 perhaps counter intuitively given his job \u2013 found he was better off professionally \u00a0for it. \u00a0 His original piece is worth a read , some of what he said resonated as I looked back over the past few weeks and thought about the debate those of us who work in social media always have about filtering out the noise. \n Those of you who have followed me on social media these past few weeks, thank you for bearing with me! \u00a0(Almost) Normal service with stats based posts resumes this week! \n (Above, US women\u2019s wheelchair basketball team leaves the North Greenwich arena after a quarter final win over Canada)"], "link": "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/2012/09/reflections-from-a-london2012-induced-social-media-detox.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.teamusa.org/": 1, "https://twitter.com/": 1, "http://www.paralympic.org": 1, "http://london2012.nytimes.com/": 1, "http://www.jux.com": 1, "http://www.eyeem.com": 1, "http://twitter.com/": 1, "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/": 2, "http://www.therabbitagency.com": 1, "http://martijnvanosch.nl/": 1, "http://greenwicholympicdiary.jux.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Lies, damned lies and statistics"}, {"content": ["I\u2019ve taken a break from this site for a few weeks, you\u2019ll find me elsewhere posting about something else I love \u2013 the Olympics! \n I\u2019ve always found it easier to get into the Olympics than say the World Cup, complete with the usual array of \u2018Enger-land\u2019 shouting. \u00a0And of course this time around the Olympics are happening in London, with the equestrian events and pentathlon happening 5 mins up the road here in Greenwich. \n As a result, I\u2019m currently posting on an Olympic themed Jux site \u2013 Greenwich Olympic Diary . \u00a0 \u00a0It allows me to try something new, and also gives me experience of working with one of the ten up and coming visual social networks I talked about in my last post. \n Perhaps see you there! \u00a0If not, normal service here resumes in a few weeks. \n Related articles \n \n  London 2012: My Olympics experience, Games volunteer Miranda Staveley \n  This Guy Stomps Out 3G Hotspots at the Olympics [Olympics]"], "link": "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/2012/08/olympic-break.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"https://greenwicholympicdiary.jux.com/": 1, "http://r.zemanta.com/": 2, "http://www.zemanta.com/": 1, "http://gizmodo.com/": 2, "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Lies, damned lies and statistics"}, {"content": ["Beyond Instagram and Pinterest \u2013 ten visual networks that should be on your radar  \n View more presentations from The Rabbit Agency (Rabbit) \n \n I\u2019ve written a lot recently about the growth of the visual web \u2013 how the big social media success stories of 2011/2012 were visual, and how imagery is becoming more important online. \n I summarised the trend in a webinar presentationI did for EyeFor Travel (link here ) \n However, though Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram have grabbed the headlines, which ones should you look out for next? \u00a0 I\u2019ve listed the ten I\u2019ve had some exposure to over the past six months, as part of my job at Rabbit . \n Sure, not all of them will be a success.\u00a0 Some will be though, and they are worth keeping on your radar. \n 1 \u2013 Jux \n  \n Less than a year old, Jux was called \u201c the most beautiful blog platform yet \u201d by The Next Web at launch and I agree. \n Think of it as an even more visual and better looking alternative to Tumblr, with a lot of the same functionality (repost articles, follow other users). \n Jux has quickly become a Rabbit favourite, with some of us (for instance catturner.jux.com \u00a0 greenwicholympicdiary.jux.com ) having recently created personal sites. \n Jux boss Ted Metcalfe is adding features all the time to improve the functionality, so this is definitely one to start to get to grips with and thinking about what you can use it for. \u00a0 Like Tumblr, the process of signing up and posting takes minutes. \n 2 \u2013 Tadaa \n  \n I wrote about Tadaa the other month , it\u2019s one of a series of photo-sharing mobile networks that could on the surface of it be considered Instagram competitors. \n However founder Niko Schoppmeier\u2019s aim isn\u2019t to compete with Instagram on numbers, which he can never win.\u00a0 Instead, it is to create a network for mobile photographers who really take pride in the quality of their content \u2013 think Vimeo vs YouTube. \n Tadaa recently went through an upgrade adding more filters and features.\u00a0 I think its a better \u2018product\u2019 than Instagram with better features and filters. \n What it\u2019s lacking at the moment is basic community features such as the ability to group images by hash-tag and the ability to call out someone publicly through @. \u00a0 The fact that Instagram lifted both of these conventions from Twitter proved to be crucial to its success. \n However, unlike Instagram you can post an image and ask other users to post images in reply \u2013 most challenges and contests on Tadaa are run like this. \u00a0 Also, both from personal experience and from what Tadaa told me \u2013 the network is \u2018busy.\u2019 \u00a0It isn\u2019t a ghost town, but has a core of committed users who come back day after day. \n 3 \u2013 EyeEm \n Like Tadaa, EyeEm is a German-based company.\u00a0 While Tadaa is iOS only, and Instagram is iOS / Android, EyeEm is a good option for Windows Phone users. \n Its a service I very much like and have started using personally. I also think its got a lot going for it, with attractive product features.\u00a0 For example, it gives you the option of filling out your caption and location for you, which is a nice touch if you are stuck with what to add. \n The interface looks good, you can call out other users through the @, and though there are no hash-tags as yet, you can instead create albums around any location or activity. \u00a0 Once you\u2019ve done this, any other user can add photos to that album. \n EyeEm seems to be taking a similar approach to Tadaa in differentiating itself in being a higher end network for mobile photo enthusiasts. \n Having said that, Britain\u2019s Race for Life charity recently chose EyeEm in preference to Instagram for its high profile event. \n 4 \u2013 500px \n  \n If Tadaa wants to be the high end Instagram, Toronto-based start-up 500px wants to be the high-end Flickr. \u00a0 The Sydney Morning Herald describes it as being \u201chome to some of the most amazing photos in the World\u201d \n Like Flickr, free membership will get you a certain amount of functionality (10 uploads a week), while paid for accounts start at $19.95. \n Recently 500px acquired another Canadian company Algo Anywhere, with the aim of integrating its recommendation system into the site. \u00a0 The fact that 500px was able to shell out $2 million on this implies a certain level of deep pockets. \n 5 \u2013 Cowbird \n Cowbird is in theory invitation only. \u00a0 It is not a photo or video sharing service, instead it is a story-telling site with added multi-media. \u00a0 Or rather, as Cowbird puts it , it is designed to become a \u201cpublic library for human experiences.\u201d \n Cowbird doesn\u2019t actually allow video as founder Jonathan Harris says a video is a story in its own right.\u00a0 It does encourage photos and sound. \n 6 \u2013 Storywheel \n Like Cowbird, Storywheel is all about (as the name says) the story. \u00a0 Anyone actually old enough to remember pre-PC age picture slide-shows will immediately get the concept. \n Storywheel is the creation of Soundcloud, the growing social network that aims to become the YouTube of audio. \u00a0 You upload a series of Instagram photos together, and then turn them into a narrated slide-show. \n 7 \u2013 Picle \n Picle is another app that meshes audio and images. \u00a0 Record ten seconds worth of sound on top of your pictures \n Picle was the idea of London digital agency Made by Many , which launched the app at SXSW. \u00a0 A month in, and it had netted 50,000 downloads. \n 8 \u2013 Socialcam and viddy \n  \n Along with Viddy , Socialcam has been described as the Instagram of mobile video. \u00a0 Instead of taking a photo with your phone, you record a short video and then as with Instagram you enhance it via a series of filters. \n There are question marks over whether Socialcam has 40 or 80 million monthly users, given accusations of gaming the Facebook app charts. \n However, even the lower figure is impressive and the service has generated a lot of noise in the US in particular . \u00a0 Brands have also started signing up , for example the Washington Post is using it for its Olympics coverage \n Rather than automatically funneling everything over to YouTube, Socialcam could be a good alternative or supplement to any video based campaign. \n Viddy is Socialcam\u2019s main competitor and differs in that it is iOS only, and also restricts your videos to 15 seconds.\u00a0 For that reason its been compared to Twitter as well as Instagram and a lot of people (myself included) prefer it to the larger socialam. \n Viddy has a fair share of celebrity users including Justin Bieber and Britney Spears \n 9 \u2013 Cinemagram \n Recently at Le Web, Instagram founder Kevin Systrom said that while he saw problems with mobile video (mainly to do with speed), he did see potential in Cinemagram . \n Cinemagram allows you to create animated photos, or cinemagraphs \u2013 the Cinemagram blog gives examples, with many users having turned these animated gifs into an art form. \n 10 \u2013 Snapguide \n  \n I think of Snapguide as the online version of picture recipe cards. \u00a0 Except its about far more than food covering DIY, technology, photography automotive and beauty to name a few. \n Basically you create a how to guide, through images. \u00a0 Typical examples include how to clean silver jewellery using toothpaste, how to make a bracelet out of a baseball, and how to make authentic Mexican salsa. \n Having recently raised $5 million, Snapguide integrates with Pinterest, and the potential-in for brands to create profiles and their own how to guides seems obvious. \n Those ten are by no means a definitive list. \u00a0 For example, in photo-sharing networks you also have Via.me and Streamzoo. \u00a0 In animated photos you also have Gifture. \u00a0 In mobile video you have Burst and Klip \u2013 and so on. \u00a0\u00a0 \n But these ten are ones that caught my eye and are good representatives of the different genres of social networks that are on the rise and that you should be aware of \u2013 story telling apps, mobile photography and mobile video."], "link": "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/2012/07/beyond-pinterest-and-instagram-ten-visual-social-networks-that-should-be-on-your-radar.html", "bloglinks": {},

presentation is above, it goes into a bit more detail about why an image led online world matters. \n SXSE? \u00a0No, that\u2019s not a typo, the event was a first and a deliberate play on its much more famous Austin namesake. \u00a0 The brain-child of Ben Stockman , the event was held in the Thirsty Bear pub in London (which has an SE1 postcode, hence the name), with a line-up of 20 odd speakers during the day. \n From Rabbit that included Cat Turner who talked about some of the work she did in the 2010 election, her presentation is super interesting for anyone who knows a bit about UK politics, and well worth checking out. \n As yet London\u2019s SXSE may be infinitely smaller than Austin\u2019s SXSW. Remember though, SXSW also started from relatively modest beginnings . \n \n \n (Featured image on the site comes from Creative Commons \u00a0) \n \n Related articles \n \n  South by South East \u2013 London, 3rd July \n \n \n \n \n  The Importance of the \u2018Visual Web\u2019 \u2013 Some Stats"], "link": "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/2012/07/ten-and-a-bit-stats-on-why-the-visual-web-matters.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"https://twitter.com/": 1, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1, "http://www.slideshare.net/": 4, "http://www.futurelab.net/blog": 2, "http://www.zemanta.com/": 1, "http://shinesquad.me/": 2, "http://www.therabbitagency.com": 1, "http://blog.eloqua.com/": 1, "http://www.co.uk/": 1, "http://www.twitter.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Lies, damned lies and statistics"}, {"content": ["I\u2019m fortunate enough that the tools of my job happen to be things I personally enjoy. \u00a0 Instagram has become my main network of choice, I check twitter first and last thing every day (and several times in between) and recently I\u2019ve even (finally) come to appreciate\u00a0 Google+. \n Facebook however I work with because I have to. \u00a0Though I understand the business need, it\u2019s a network I personally dislike. \n I could write a whole post on the reasons why, but the point is\u00a0you\u2019d think I\u2019d welcome any stats showing Facebook on the decline. \u00a0In fact, I\u2019m going to argue that the latest figures suggesting that this is happening should be treated with caution. \n Those figures come from Comscore, showing that Facebook\u2019s US user base has declined 4.8% in six months to 158 million. \n So is Facebook finally heading slowly the way of MySpace? \u00a0Hardly. \u00a0Here is why: \n In his critique (which I agree with) of Facebook\u2019s mission to promote \u2018authentic identity\u2019, analyst and blogger Wagner James Au pointed out that Facebook probably has a ceiling of just over 50% market penetration of a country\u2019s online population, and it has reached that point for the US, the UK and Canada \n I think that is right\u2026when you are talking about the major industrialised nations. \u00a0In the Philippines for instance, Facebook has a whopping 92.9% penetration of the Internet population , and in the developing world that online population is only going to grow. \n \n The chart above above from the World Bank ( via Google ) shows that the % of the population on the Internet in the major English speaking countries has increased over the past few years. But when you look at the BRICS countries (and I added The Philippines in for good measure) those numbers in some cases more than doubled in the second part of the last decade. \n As Facebook is well aware, the home market of the US is no longer pre-eminent online. \u00a0Especially given the evidence that social media users in emerging markets are highly engaged , this is still a huge growth opportunity. \n Secondly this story seems to do the rounds every Summer. \u00a0Almost exactly a year ago, news came out of a so-called \u2018big drop\u2019 in user numbers. \u00a0 As I wrote at the time , when even the Murdoch owned The Sun starts talking about users \u2018abandoning\u2019 the service, you know the idea has common currency. \n Guess what? \u00a0Facebook came out of last Summer just fine, and whatever the subsequent problems, managed to IPO. \u00a0Look out for another wave of Facebook in decline posts in June 2013. \n Social media e-commerce referrals from Facebook drop 88% to 59% \n  \n Here is one recent Facebook stat that brands should be aware of. \u00a0Facebook\u2019s share of e-commerce referrals from social media\u00a0 has dropped from 88% to 59% \u2013 that is significant. \n According to Monetate, which came out with the report, this is directly connected to the growth in non PC mobile and tablet traffic, and also the rise of Pinterest, whose share of referral traffic has gone up from 0.68% in Q1 2011, to 26% in Q1 2012. \u00a0No wonder Facebook is looking at a \u2018want\u2019 button . \n Never mind though. \u00a0Just as he did with Instagram to plug a mobile gap, I\u2019m sure Mark Zuckerberg can dip into his pocket and find another $1 billion to buy Pinterest or someone similar. \n Related articles \n \n  The visual web \u2013 big in the Philippines, the US, Canada, UK and Spain \n \n \n \n \n  Top Trends of 2012: The Visual Web \n \n \n \n \n  Infographic of the Week: Instagram Nation \n \n \n \n \n  Google+ for tablets is the mobile app Facebook should have designed"], "link": "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/2012/06/facebook-still-dominant-in-numbers-less-so-in-referrals.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://therealtimereport.com/": 1, "http://www.businessinsider.com/": 1, "https://plus.google.com/": 1, "http://www.othersidegroup.com/": 2, "http://www.internetevolution.com/": 1, "http://www.readwriteweb.com/": 2, "http://statigr.am/": 1, "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/": 1, "http://www.zemanta.com/": 1, "http://venturebeat.com/": 2, "http://www.therabbitagency.com": 1, "http://www.co.uk/": 1, "http://www.twitter.com/": 1, "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/": 5, "http://www.cbsnews.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Lies, damned lies and statistics"}, {"content": ["According to Royal Pingdom, Pinterest is probably now bigger than Tumblr in the US .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I say probably, as Royal Pingdom consulted a number of sources from Comscore to Google Trends to Alexa, and they all gave slightly different results. \n Even if Pinterest is only slightly behind that\u2019s still a huge achievement, underscoring its 4377% growth over the past year ( according to Comscore ) \n Royal Pingdom does however suggest that based on Google Insights, Pinterest is heavily US based, while Tumblr is global. \n Google Insights is based on search queries, so I personally have gone back to Alexa, which shows that the top Pinterest, Tumblr and Instagram countries are as follows.\u00a0 Note this is based on the ranking in their individual countries, not overall. \n Certainly Alexa suggests that Pinterest has not only passed Tumblr in the US, but in Canada, South Africa and Australia as well (though not in the UK). \n But what about Instagram?\u00a0\u00a0 Instagram is off course an application and mobile network, with (when I checked on 28 June) 56.2 million users.\u00a0\u00a0 You don\u2019t access it via the web unless you go through a web client such as Statigram .\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, a look at web traffic still shows general interest and popularity. \n What do these stats show?\u00a0 They show that all three of the big visual social networks feature highly in the Philippines.\u00a0\u00a0 Along with (as expected), the US, Canada, Spain, and the UK. \n The importance of social media in the Philippines has been documented before.\u00a0 Last year the country was found to be the top Facebook market by % of the Internet population using it (92.9%) . \n And speaking of Instagram, at the start of the year, #igersmanila (the Manila chapter of the Instagramers super-fan group) had the highest number of tagged photos worldwide. \u00a0 \n Related articles \n \n  Pinterest has overtaken Tumblr in the United States \n \n \n \n \n  Top Trends of 2012: The Visual Web \n \n \n \n \n  Pinterest: The Next Social Frontier for Music \n \n \n \n \n  The Importance of the \u2018Visual Web\u2019 \u2013 Some Stats"], "link": "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/2012/06/the-visual-web-big-in-the-philippines-the-us-canada-uk-and-spain.html", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://techcrunch.com/": 1, "http://www.readwriteweb.com/": 4, "http://statigr.am/": 1, "http://www.futurelab.net/blog": 2, "http://www.zemanta.com/": 1, "http://royal.pingdom.com/": 3, "http://www.google.com/": 1, "http://liesdamnedliesstatistics.com/": 3}, "blogtitle": "Lies, damned lies and statistics"}]
