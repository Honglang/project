In the past twelve months, the official interest rate issued by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has being cut by a drastic 150 basis points, helping to renew the faith of home owners Australia wide. While this news comes as a positive turn of events for many Australians, what exactly does it mean for home owners? \n Basing calculations on an average Australian mortgage of $300, 000 home owners will have the opportunity to save $50 per month, with each 25 point decrease, an enormous help for many Australian families. This $50 per month saving, however, will only be received by home owners whose lenders pass on the full extent of the interest rate cut. \nMany reputable financial institutions and debt solutions companies are recommending that home owners do not pocket the savings, but continue to pay off their mortgage as they are currently doing so. While this may sound like an odd piece of advice, it is calculated that those who choose to continue their regular payments could be eligible to save more than $100, 000 in interest payments and 8 years off their loan term. \n If you are unsure of how the RBA interest rate cut will affect your family, it is a smart decision to talk to a debt solutions specialist. The team at Fox Symes are leading experts in the finance industry and can provide assistance in making the right decisions for your future. \n \n Infographic Review \n Infographic Design: B+ \n \n \n Infographic Information: B \n Related Infographics: Australian Bank Notes Infographic The Australian bank notes are a little different that most ...

I like that each place is shown in an actual image that represents that place. They are numbered so that readers can follow the list. I like that they are separate from each other in their own little section with different fonts and backgrounds. \n Infographic Information: B+ \n The information may seem simple but it clearly gives a description of each place and why it is nice to retire there. I was surprised by some of the places but I know that many people would enjoy these exotic places.

It looks like the Infographic just starts off with a sentence. I would have chosen a shorter title and then put a subtitle underneath if it was necessary. I like the black and grey colors because they give the infographic a sleek car feel. The graphs are good and display the information in a unique and fun way. \n Infographic Information: B \n The information actually gives good data that readers will find interesting. I like the breakdown of the actual number s of auto thefts. I like the last section because it tells readers exactly what they should do to protect themselves from car theft.

I like that there are different scenes that break up the infographic and showcase different information. The title is big and right from the beginning readers will know what the infographic is about. The font that some of the text is in has a creepy scary look to it as well which again adds to the Halloween theme. \n Infographic Information: B \n The information was interesting and shocking to see. I think the biggest shock to read was how much Americans will spend on Halloween. I also liked the chart that broke down where people get costumes ideas from. The majority got them from the stores while my favorite place to get a costume idea is from pop culture. I was surprised to see such a low number of Americans actually take their kids trick or treating. I thought this number would have been higher as it seems so many children enjoy trick or treating.

Some people use these payday loan resources as a way to make ends meet until they get paid. Others see it as a vicious cycle that traps people in debt. This infographic looks at who hates payday loans the most and why. \n  \n Infographic Review \n Infographic Design: C \n \n The first thing I notice about the design is that there are very few images and lot of numbers. When I see something that has a lot of numbers I am already not willing to read it. It is important to create an infographic that will attract people to read it. Unfortunately this infographic does not do that. There are just too many numbers and statistics that overpower the infographic. \n Infographic Information: B \n The information is interesting because it shares some thoughts on payday loans and why people either love them or hate them. It was interesting to see the difference of opinions between borrowers and non-borrowers. I like how they do show the demographic information about payday loans because it shows the people who are using it really do appreciate and need it. The main people who \u201chate\u201d against payday loans are the ones who do not use them. The main point I think the infographic shares is that if you are going to use a payday loan you need to be educated about them. \n Related Infographics: Financial Aid Roadmap Infographic \n\nAh Financial Aid.

Check out this infographic if you are looking for a new and trendy feature to add to your outdoor living area. \n  \n Infographic Review \n Infographic Design: A \n \n I really think the design for this infographic works perfectly for the information. The tan and white background has an outdoors feel and the pergola is clearly shown at the top of the infographic. The title clearly communicates what the infographic is about. All of the subsections are divided perfectly allowing the information to be taken in bit by bit. All of the images that are used are appropriate and I especially like the image at the very bottom which shows all of the different plants that can grow on a pergola. I like that the images slowly take on color as the reader approached the bottom and then at the bottom the whole image is in color. \n Infographic Information: A \n The information gives a clear understanding of what a pergola is and the many styles that are available.
