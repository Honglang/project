Abstract Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/5808621423794542230/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://projectreporter.nih.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}, {"content": ["Great new paper from Dr. Trudy Mackay at NC State.

Epistasis dominates the genetic architecture of Drosophila quantitative traits. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Sep 4. [ PubMed ] Abstract Epistasis-nonlinear genetic interactions between polymorphic loci-is the genetic basis of canalization and speciation, and epistatic interactions can be used to infer genetic networks affecting quantitative traits. However, the role that epistasis plays in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial. Here, we compared the genetic architecture of three Drosophila life history traits in the sequenced inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and a large outbred, advanced intercross population derived from 40 DGRP lines (Flyland). We assessed allele frequency changes between pools of individuals at the extremes of the distribution for each trait in the Flyland population by deep DNA sequencing. The genetic architecture of all traits was highly polygenic in both analyses. Surprisingly, none of the SNPs associated with the traits in Flyland replicated in the DGRP and vice versa. However, the majority of these SNPs participated in at least one epistatic interaction in the DGRP. Despite apparent additive effects at largely distinct loci in the two populations, the epistatic interactions perturbed common, biologically plausible, and highly connected genetic networks. Our analysis underscores the importance of epistasis as a principal factor that determines variation for quantitative traits and provides a means to uncover genetic networks affecting these traits. Knowledge of epistatic networks will contribute to our understanding of the genetic basis of evolutionarily and clinically important traits and enhance predictive ability at an individualized level in medicine and agriculture."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/7351416596823265624/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nih.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}, {"content": ["There has been a lot of discussion online the last few days about the value of journal impact factors for judging the quality of publications.

Finding the sources of missing heritability in a yeast cross Joshua S. Bloom, Ian M. Ehrenreich, Wesley Loo, Th\u00fay-Lan V\u00f5 Lite, Leonid Kruglyak Abstract For many traits, including susceptibility to common diseases in humans, causal loci uncovered by genetic mapping studies explain only a minority of the heritable contribution to trait variation. Multiple explanations for this \"missing heritability\" have been proposed. Here we use a large cross between two yeast strains to accurately estimate different sources of heritable variation for 46 quantitative traits and to detect underlying loci with high statistical power. We find that the detected loci explain nearly the entire additive contribution to heritable variation for the traits studied. We also show that the contribution to heritability of gene-gene interactions varies among traits, from near zero to 50%. Detected two-locus interactions explain only a minority of this contribution. These results substantially advance our understanding of the missing heritability problem and have important implications for future studies of complex and quantitative traits."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/249283737914957643/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://arxiv.org/": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}, {"content": ["There is a great new piece in Science on \"Modular Biological Complexity\".

As a result, our ability to predict susceptibility to visual diseases will depend critically on the computational, mathematical and statistical modeling methods and software that are available for making sense of high-dimensional genetic data. We propose here a bioinformatics research project to develop network modeling approaches for identifying combinations of genetic biomarkers associated with visual disease endpoints. Our working hypothesis is that a systems-based bioinformatics approach using network modeling will play a very important role in confronting the complexity of the relationship between genomic variation and visual diseases. We will first develop and evaluate modeling methods to infer large-scale genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association studies (AIM 1). We will then apply the modeling methods developed in AIM 1 to the inference of genetic interaction networks from genome-wide association data in subjects with and without visual diseases (AIM 2). Next, we will utilize the inferred genetic interaction networks to guide the development of predictive genetic models of visual diseases (AIM 3). Finally, all network modeling methods will be released to the vision research community as part of a popular user-friendly, freely available and open-source software package (AIM 4).

Xu L, Barker B, Gu Z. Dynamic epistasis for different alleles of the same gene. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Jun 11. [ PubMed ] Abstract Epistasis refers to the phenomenon in which phenotypic consequences caused by mutation of one gene depend on one or more mutations at another gene. Epistasis is critical for understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes, including pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction, mutational load, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the origin of life. Nevertheless, current understandings for the genome-wide distribution of epistasis are mostly inferred from interactions among one mutant type per gene, whereas how epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different mutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we address this issue by combining predictions from flux balance analysis and data from a recently published high-throughput experiment. Our results show that different alleles can epistatically interact with very different gene sets. Furthermore, between two random mutant alleles of the same gene, the chance for the allele with more severe mutational consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative epistasis than the other allele is 50\u223c70% in eukaryotic organisms, but only 20\u223c30% in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model that predicts that the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can speed up the process of purging deleterious mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our results indicate that epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the genome level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can integrate epistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/2399633518497995788/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nih.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}, {"content": ["This new piece in Science magazine summarizes nicely some of my concerns about the integration of whole genome sequencing into the clinic.

BMC Bioinformatics 2012, 13(Suppl 9):S5 [ BMC ] Abstract (provisional) Background Because common complex diseases are affected by multiple genes and environmental factors, it is essential to investigate gene-gene and/or gene-environment interactions to understand genetic architecture of complex diseases. After the great success of large scale genome-wide association (GWA) studies using the high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips, the study of gene-gene interaction becomes a next challenge. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis has been widely used for the gene-gene interaction analysis. In practice, however, it is not easy to perform high order gene-gene interaction analyses via MDR in genome-wide level because it requires exploring a huge search space and suffers from a computational burden due to high dimensionality. Results We propose dimensional reduction analysis, Gene-MDR analysis for the fast and efficient high order gene-gene interaction analysis. The proposed Gene-MDR method is composed of two-step applications of MDR: within- and between-gene MDR analyses. First, within-gene MDR analysis summarizes each gene effect via MDR analysis by combining multiple SNPs from the same gene. Second, between-gene MDR analysis then performs interaction analysis using the summarized gene effects from within-gene MDR analysis. We apply the Gene-MDR method to bipolar disorder (BD) GWA data from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). The results demonstrate that Gene-MDR is capable of detecting high order gene-gene interactions associated with BD.

[ PubMed ] Abstract There is growing evidence that much more of the genome than previously thought is required to explain the heritability of complex phenotypes. Recent studies have demonstrated that numerous common variants from across the genome explain portions of genetic variability, spawning various avenues of research directed at explaining the remaining heritability. This polygenic structure is also the motivation for the growing application of pathway and gene set enrichment techniques, which have yielded promising results. These findings suggest that the coordination of genes in pathways that are known to occur at the gene regulatory level also can be detected at the population level. Although genes in these networks interact in complex ways, most population studies have focused on the additive contribution of common variants and the potential of rare variants to explain additional variation. In this brief review, we discuss the potential to explain additional genetic variation through the agglomeration of multiple gene-gene interactions as well as main effects of common variants in terms of a network paradigm. Just as is the case for single-locus contributions, we expect each gene-gene interaction edge in the network to have a small effect, but these effects may be reinforced through hubs and other connectivity structures in the network. We discuss some of the opportunities and challenges of network methods for analyzing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) such as the study of hubs and motifs, and integrating other types of variation and environmental interactions. Such network approaches may unveil hidden variation in GWAS, improve understanding of mechanisms of disease, and possibly fit into a network paradigm of evolutionary genetics."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/4640423650782226693/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nih.gov/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}, {"content": ["Great new article by Duncan Thomas that raises a number of very interesting questions about genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Big Science, dominant journals with large influence and the role of consortia in the sociology of sciences.

There are some issues in the sociology of science that are worth attention: How are new investigators to find their niche in such an environment without becoming lost in a list of hundreds of authors? What is the role of investigator-initiated studies and novel or paradigm-shifting ideas? Is the dominance of a single journal, by virtue of its impact factor, in setting the agenda for the entire field a good thing?

Genetic Epidemiology, in press (2012) [ Wiley ] Abstract: In a commentary on the evolution of the field of genetic epidemiology over the past 10 years, Khoury et al. (2011) highlight several important developments, including the emergence of evaluation of genetic discoveries for their translational utility and of standards for reporting genetic findings. In this companion to their article, I reflect on some of these trends and speculate about the direction of the field in the future. In particular, I emphasize the opportunities posed by novel technologies like next-generation sequencing and the biological insights emerging from integrative genomics, but I also question the utility of large consortia. The basic principles of population-based research and the importance of taking account of the environment remain important to the field."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/3775120315091007393/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}, {"content": ["Here is a new MDR paper from Kristel Van Steen.

PLoS One. 2012;7(1):e29594. [ PubMed ] Abstract Identifying gene-gene interactions or gene-environment interactions in studies of human complex diseases remains a big challenge in genetic epidemiology. An additional challenge, often forgotten, is to account for important lower-order genetic effects. These may hamper the identification of genuine epistasis. If lower-order genetic effects contribute to the genetic variance of a trait, identified statistical interactions may simply be due to a signal boost of these effects. In this study, we restrict attention to quantitative traits and bi-allelic SNPs as genetic markers. Moreover, our interaction study focuses on 2-way SNP-SNP interactions. Via simulations, we assess the performance of different corrective measures for lower-order genetic effects in Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction epistasis detection, using additive and co-dominant coding schemes. Performance is evaluated in terms of power and familywise error rate. Our simulations indicate that empirical power estimates are reduced with correction of lower-order effects, likewise familywise error rates. Easy-to-use automatic SNP selection procedures, SNP selection based on \"top\" findings, or SNP selection based on p-value criterion for interesting main effects result in reduced power but also almost zero false positive rates. Always accounting for main effects in the SNP-SNP pair under investigation during Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis adequately controls false positive epistasis findings. This is particularly true when adopting a co-dominant corrective coding scheme. In conclusion, automatic search procedures to identify lower-order effects to correct for during epistasis screening should be avoided. The same is true for procedures that adjust for lower-order effects prior to Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction and involve using residuals as the new trait. We advocate using \"on-the-fly\" lower-order effects adjusting when screening for SNP-SNP interactions using Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction analysis."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/79219021487503948/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nih.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}, {"content": ["I am collaborating with Drs.

The causes of epistasis. Proc Biol Sci. 2011 Dec 22;278(1725):3617-24. [ PubMed ] Abstract Since Bateson's discovery that genes can suppress the phenotypic effects of other genes, gene interactions-called epistasis-have been the topic of a vast research effort. Systems and developmental biologists study epistasis to understand the genotype-phenotype map, whereas evolutionary biologists recognize the fundamental importance of epistasis for evolution. Depending on its form, epistasis may lead to divergence and speciation, provide evolutionary benefits to sex and affect the robustness and evolvability of organisms. That epistasis can itself be shaped by evolution has only recently been realized. Here, we review the empirical pattern of epistasis, and some of the factors that may affect the form and extent of epistasis. Based on their divergent consequences, we distinguish between interactions with or without mean effect, and those affecting the magnitude of fitness effects or their sign. Empirical work has begun to quantify epistasis in multiple dimensions in the context of metabolic and fitness landscape models. We discuss possible proximate causes (such as protein function and metabolic networks) and ultimate factors (including mutation, recombination, and the importance of natural selection and genetic drift). We conclude that, in general, pleiotropy is an important prerequisite for epistasis, and that epistasis may evolve as an adaptive or intrinsic consequence of changes in genetic robustness and evolvability."], "link": "http://compgen.blogspot.com/feeds/3023362335650261218/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.nih.gov/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Epistasis Blog"}]
