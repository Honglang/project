Due to changes in the manufacturer\u2019s evidence, the AG - Paul Tappenden, Sue Harnan, Lesley Uttley, Matthew Mildred, Chris Carroll, and Anna Cantrell \u2013 got to produce several reports, all of which are available here . In summary : \u201cThe Committee noted that there was no economic analysis which compared colistimethate sodium DPI with nebulised colistimethate, the preferred comparator, according to clinical specialists on UK clinical practice. The results of the Committee's preferred economic analysis showed that colistimethate sodium DPI was less effective and less costly than nebulised tobramycin. The Committee concluded that although the analysis showed potential for cost savings, the clinical evidence for colistimethate sodium DPI was not robust enough to conclusively show that it is a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The Committee noted that the results of the economic analysis for tobramycin DPI compared with nebulised tobramycin showed that tobramycin DPI was cheaper and slightly more effective, although associated with some uncertainty. Despite the limitations of all the data and the uncertainty in the model, the Committee agreed that it was reasonable to conclude that tobramycin DPI was a cost effective use of NHS resources in people with cystic fibrosis who would otherwise have been treated with nebulised tobramycin.\u201d Of interest: Several analyses produced ICERs for one of the new drugs in the SW quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, which complicated the discussion in the ACD . The Assessment Group carried out a sensitivity analysis using the Commercial Medicines Unit (CMU) Electronic Marketing Information Tool (E-MIT) price rather than the BNF list price for nebulised tobramycin. In September 2012, the estimated price of tobramycin paid by the NHS was \u00a3970.12 rather than the list price of \u00a31187. This is in the ACD and was clearly considered by the Committee.

Produced by NICE's Medicines and Prescribing Centre (which was formed following the transfer into NICE of the National Prescribing Centre in April 2011), these outputs provide a summary of the published evidence for selected unlicensed or off-label medicines that are considered to be of significance to the NHS, where there are no clinically appropriate licensed alternatives.

Abstract: Response time targets for the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust (WAST) are not currently being met, particularly for high priority emergencies in rural areas. Collaborative work between WAST and the Cardiff OR Group, has explored the use of different research methodologies to assist WAST with decisions on ambulance locations, capacities and deployments. This talk will provide an overview of the different approaches and tools developed, including forecasting demand, time-dependent queueing models and optimisation for crew rostering, a geographical discrete event simulation and location theory for locations and deployment, and phase-type models to explore the impact of ambulance turn-around times at hospitals.

By Ben Kearns, Roberta Ara and Allan Wailoo. From the Executive Summary: \u201cOf the 79 technology appraisals examined, 47 included at least one regression analysis and a total of 91 separate regression analyses were reported. 56 were de novo analyses provided by the manufacturer/sponsor of the technology (34 from Single Technology Appraisals and 22 from Multiple Technology Appraisals), while the remaining 35 were sourced from existing published literature. Over 50% involved health state utility values with the balance involving health care costs (11%) or probabilities of clinical events (35%). For the de novo analyses, reporting was poorest around the sample size used, the justification of the type of model estimated, the selection of covariates used, the strategy for identifying the preferred final model and any validation used. Across all the analyses, there was potential for improvement in the reporting of: the description of the dataset, the model type, the rationale for inclusion of model covariates, the validity of the final model and the uncertainty in the model. Statistical regression models are in widespread use in NICE TAs yet reporting standards relating to basic information are poor. Whilst some of this may be due to the word limit imposed on TAs, there is still scope for improvement. This is important as increasing levels of reporting transparency enable policy decision makers to have increasing levels of confidence in the resulting estimates of cost-effectiveness. We suggest a series of recommendations that could be used for the minimum reporting requirements for any statistical regression analyses used in a DAM.\u201d"], "link": "http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4587359407049192416/posts/default/4857785375479104071", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.org.uk/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Health Economics and Decision Science Blog @ ScHARR"}, {"content": ["The NICE Decision Support Unit has just published A review of studies examining the relationship between progression-free survival and overall survival in advanced or metastatic cancer , by Sarah Davis, Paul Tappenden, Anna Cantrell. From the Executive Summary: \u201cNineteen papers were included in the review covering eight different tumour types. Four studies used aggregate data from multiple trials to examine the relationship between PFS and OS for individual trial arms. Seven studies used individual patient data to examine the relationship between PFS and OS for individual patients. Thirteen studies examined the trial level relationship between treatment effect on PFS and treatment effect on OS with three using individual patient data, whilst the remainder used aggregate data from multiple trials. A variety of statistical techniques were employed within these studies, with the most commonly used being rank correlation coefficients, linear regression and landmark analysis. The lack of a standardised approach made it difficult to establish whether there is a consistent relationship between PFS/TTP and OS. The majority of the studies found a positive correlation between PFS/TTP and OS for individual patients, individual trial arms and the treatment effect between trial arms, although, the size of the correlation and its statistical significance varied considerably across studies. This is not surprising given the variety of methods employed and the variation in studies characteristics such as differences in the tumour type and the line of therapy considered.\u201d As for the conclusions, you\u2019ll have to read the report\u2026.."], "link": "http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4587359407049192416/posts/default/6082881336574232345", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.org.uk/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Health Economics and Decision Science Blog @ ScHARR"}, {"content": ["The following articles were published by researchers within HEDS in September.
