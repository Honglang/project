IBMs\u2019 Watson-in-a-box or Googles\u2019 Cloud Grid ? As we saw yesterday, Watson was able to beat both of the best human jeopardy players. \n But how would Google have performed? Given the presumption, that Google did not intentionally change their results to achieve good at the following test, we can check out what ranking Google would have given to the Jeopardy questions. The J! Archive is a good source to find the questions. All Ranks regarding the \u201cjeopardy\u201d Question are ignored in this little test with use of the \u201c-jeopardy\u201d tag. \n \n Those are the first 10 Questions that Watson answered correctly on the 16th February game (Click on the Link to see Googles result): \n \n Each year the EU selects capitals of culture: one of the 2010 cities was this Turkish \u201cmeeting place of cultures\u201d , Answer: Istanbul \n Elected every 5 years, it has 736 members from 7 parties , Answer: Parliament \n While Maltese borrows many words from Italian, it developed from a dialect of this Semitic language , Answer: Arabic \n Aeolic, spoken in ancient times, was a dialect of this , Answer: Ancient Greek \n Gambler Charles Wells is believed to have inspired the song \u201cThe Man Who\u201d did this \u201cAt Monte Carlo\u201d , Answer: Broke the Bank \n Nearly 10 million YouTubers saw Dave Carroll\u2019s clip called this \u201cfriendly skies\u201d airline \u201cbreaks guitars\u201d , Answer: United Airlines \n Vedic, dating back at least 4,000 years, is the earliest dialect of this classical language of India , Answer: Sanskrit \n Before this hotel mogul\u2019s elbow broke through it, a Picasso he owned was worth $139 million; after, $85 million , Answer: Steve Wynn \n A controversial EU subsidy program is called CAP, short for \u201ccommon\u201d this \u201cpolicy\u201d, Answer: Agricultural \n Sprechen Sie Plattdeutsch? If you do, you speak the low variety of this language , Answer: German \n \n As you can see now totally spammed by Jeopardy regarding articles but once possible to see the correct answer is always found on the top ranks of Google\u2019s results; if not in the headline, at least in the introducing texts of the results. The interpretation and announcing of the result is, of course, still to handle (text mining, evaluation, create voice output and so on). \n Since the questions have been shown in text, a \u201cSpeech recognition\u201d might have been obsolete, a OCR and an interface to the Google API might have produced some enjoyable results, too. \n If not done, definitely check out Watsons last Jeopardy rounds:"], "link": "http://www.data-mining-blog.com/data-mining/the-real-data-mining-battle-watson-vs-google/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.data-mining-blog.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 3, "http://www.google.com/": 10, "http://www.j-archive.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Data Mining - Blog.com"}, {"content": ["\u00a9 Triangulate, Inc. \n The new start-up company \u201c triangulate \u201d from Palo Alto, CA, wants to \u201cempower people to use their own data to make the world better\u201d. To make this honourable aim possible they are distributing their first software \u201c Wings \u201c, a Facebook application. This tool creates user-profiles with the help of data mining methods, and matches them to find fitting partners. \n The software is not working with a form, in which the users have to put their interests, but sources the traces users left in the web. It gains information not only from Facebook, it also uses others sources like for example Last.fm or netflix , to find out the users music or video taste. Twitter is used to determine the topics a user may be interested in. \n \n Sunil Nagaraj, CEO of Triangulate, reports on significant conclusions they made while developing the software. For instance, the density of a users\u2019 social network determines his or her preference of a partner. The more the network is closed, the less a random encounter of a new person will lead to a partnership. In this case it is more likely that the next partner will be from the closed network. \n Wings at Facebook \n However the high volatility of the users\u2019 characteristics are difficult to handle. Some people change their music taste every day \u2013 that may a relevant characteristic as well, but surely less important then a special music genre that is preferred and shared with the dream-partner . \n The young start-up got 750.000$ (562.000 \u20ac) from investors to enter the very important dating-market. It has to compete against big players like match.com or eHarmony , which are using mighty dating data mining solutions for many years by now. \n An important measure for a dating-recommendation engine is the visual nature of the potential partner. This aspect is very important for many partner seekers, and the data is mostly reduced to some body-measures that are more or less honestly given. To analyse and model a data mining solution that is capable to find out whether a persons photo creates sympathy or not is not trivial at all. Another dating-data-mining project called okcupid.com uses straight forwarded data mining algorithms, too, and focuses the visual nature in detail . \n\n\n Related posts: Cloud Mining at Layered Technologies?

That is why more and more\u00a0 data mining tools arise that try to avoid experts and give smaller or even more complicate reports into the hands of the business analyst. Big vendor SAS now offers a new product that fits into that scheme; the SAS Rapid Predictive Modeler . \n SAS stressed that this tool indeed focusses on the business analyst, and says it will enable even subject-matter experts with limited statistical expertise to build reliable and robust data mining models. This eventually leading to useful and descriptive reports and graphs. \n \n  SAS\u00ae Rapid Predictive Modeler Screenshot \n It works with the visual interface of either SAS Enterprise Guide or Microsoft Excel, with the SAS Add-In for Microsoft Office. \n The user is guided automatically through the data preparation and all the necessary data mining tasks. \n SAS stated that statisticians may \u201cgenerate quick, baseline models when they are short on time and resources\u201d. This actually says that if you have a bit more time and resources, it may end up in better-than-baseline results. When using the big brother of the tool: the Rapid Predictive Modeler is a part of SAS Enterprise Miner 6.2, which must be licensed anyway. \n Regarding to the license costs, companies probably should spend some extra money and hire a good data miner, too.

The .Net tool is equipped with multiple plugins to solve certain tasks. \nIt works fine with text files that get sorted and linked. A huge deal for the developers seems to be to provide users with an easy drag\u2019n\u2019drop environment. And this was quite well done. The selection and handling of data is simple and efficient. The most important part for us is the module \u201cFastStats Modelling\u201d \u2013 since this is where the Data Mining takes place. \n \n Apteco implemented the patented \u201cPredictive Weight of Evidence (PWE)\u201d procedure and decision trees methods. In this module the drag\u2019n\u2019drop handling was a big issue as well \u2013 the application is handled easily and will be no problem for our collogues of the marketing department. In fact, if it is for instance needed to select a certain customer target group that should be detected by using a trained model, that task is fulfilled in a short time. The complete data can be shown in detail, or if preferred, it can be presented simplified. \nThe success of the model can be measured monetary. It is possible to integrate the expected conversion rate, the revenue per gained customer and the costs of the campaign into the analysis. That helps to judge the outcomes and to find out which model fits best. \nThis tool provides a good first step into Data Mining for marketing campaigns; hence it only has few methods to apply. The segmentation of customers and the optimizing of campaigns for special target groups, combined with the option to find product-affinities of customers makes \u201cFastStats Modelling\u201d a useful tool for the offered price. The usability of the drag\u2019n\u2019drop user interface is a outstanding way that will hopefully be adapted by other vendors. \n\n\n Related posts: Cloud Mining \u2013 CRM Data Mining in the Cloud Cloud Mining is an cost-reducing approach to let smaller companies... \n RapidMiner from Rapid-I at CeBIT 2010 RapidMiner is a Data Mining Suite of the German company..."], "link": "http://www.data-mining-blog.com/data-mining-tools/faststats-modelling-data-mining/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.apteco.com/": 1, "http://www.data-mining-blog.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Data Mining - Blog.com"}, {"content": ["Amazon AWS \n Cloud Mining with Oracles ODM is available on the Amazon Cloud since end of February 2010, as shown at Oracles Website .

At CeBIT I had the opportunity to talk to\u00a0 Co-Founder Ralf Klinkenberg about his software and get some interesting information, for example if RapidMiner is ready for Cloud Mining. \n \n RapidMiner auf der CeBIT 2010 \n RapidMiner , formerly known as YALE , has been developed at the German university of Dortmund , beginning in 2001. Since then it has definitely proved its impressive functionality, I for myself used it the first time for a Data Mining contest in 2006 (being quite successful). Meanwhile it is hosted at the open source developing platform sourceforge and is also developed further on this site. Right now the 5th version is available. \n \n Rapid-I provides Enterprise Editions \n Out of the necessity from many companies to reduce the common open source risks, and to provide a business partner that can give support, the company Rapid-I GmbH was founded by the developers of YALE. Here CEO Dr. Ingo Mierswa , CBDO Ralf Klinkenberg and their co-workers distribute three different Enterprise Editions of RapidMiner; the SMALL, STANDART and the DEVELOPER Edition. These certified versions of the open source product supply customers with the needed liability to run it in the companies IT-infrastructure. For these editions the roll-out of the 5th version already took place, too. \n Rapid-I Co-Founder and CBDO Ralf Klinkenberg with co-worker Anna Szot and Dr. Simon Fischer (from left) \n Data Mining with RapidMiner \n RapidMiner is a complete Data Mining suite. That means, it provides all steps of the KDD process from the interface to the database and the ETL to the analytics and the reporting tool. The tool supports more then dizzying 500 Data Mining methods due to its open source roots. And it has proven reliability in many tests, for example at BARC as the best open source tool. An intuitive and modern graphical user interface gives the experienced data mining expert the opportunity to solve nearly all problems he has to face in practice scenarios. The software works with virtual repositories, so that the data can technically lie anywhere. Meta-data can be accessed at every step of the development. A remarkable feature is the real-time validation. In the design process partial results can be obtained, so the usual trial-and-error approach is noticeable simplified. You find some good video tutorials at the RapidMiner website. \n More than Data Mining \n RapidMiner has won lots of functionality over the years of development. The clear-cut analytical tool YALE from the past gave way to a modern enterprise tool, that has its own derived solutions for several typical hands-on problems: \n \n RapidAnalytics : an enterprise server architecture \n RapidDoc : Text Mining and document classification \n RapidSentilyser : market insight (how often and in which context a companies name is mentioned in the media?) \n RapidNet : explorer to discover connections between components in a network \n \n The BuzzBoard in RapidSentilyser \n The BuzzBoard is a dashboard for RapidSentilyser allows to track real-rime feedback of publicitiy measures of companies. I saw an impressive example of this clearly arranged results; finance news of the last years were compared to news of the last week \u2013 all focused on one multinational company. It was highlighted, if the company was mentioned in \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d coherences. That made it easy to find out if the last publicity activity paid its due with the help of a single measure figure. That is only possible with a high-end Data Mining basement, of course. \n Cloud Mining with RapidMiner \n The client-server architecture of RapidAnalytics makes it possible to put the repository anywhere, also in the Cloud. That means RapidMiner is in principle ready for the use in the Cloud. But the core advantage of a Cloud Mining solution, the parallelization of the algorithms and the scoring engine, has not been explicit focused. That makes RapidMiner with RapidAnalytics best capable in conventional big company infrastructures. \n\n\n Related posts: CeBIT 2010: Cloud Mining soon at SAS? SAS Institute Inc.
