I know because I, for one, was interested, and went looking. I found that people had discovered a few interesting things \u2014 among them that the remote for the F1 also works with the FH100 . I also went asking for help from people close to the problem \u2014 and got zero response, which also aggravates the hell out of me.

I\u2019d be surprised if they didn\u2019t put the camera into some kind of service mode or something. Also, given that the pins are populated on the video cable, it seems possible to create a shutter release using that cable if you don\u2019t have one, even though you\u2019d probably have to cut all the way down to the connector to access those pins. \n There are a bunch of higher-resolution images, including images of the EX-F1 and EX-FH100 connector here . \n That\u2019s all for now.

Video: \n \n Gather your stuff in one place: \n An SDM/CHDK capable camera . \n A USB extension cord or socket. \n A tattoo machine pedal from eBay. \n A 3AAA holder. \n 3 AAA batteries. \n A soldering iron. \n A screwdriver. \n A wire stripper. \n Heat shrink tubing or tape. \n \n Remove the screws that hold the top of the pedal. \n \n Inside, you\u2019ll see a switch and a spring. See them. \n \n Unsolder the top wire from the switch. This will become our ground wire. \n \n Put heat shrink tubing on one side. Solder it to the black wire from the battery pack. \n \n Apply heat. Your torch may be blurry; that\u2019s OK. \n \n Solder the red wire to the top terminal of the switch. \n \n Apply foil tape or some other tape to the bottom of the battery pack. \n \n Stick it in place. \n \n Screw it back together. You know you want to. \n \n The cable that comes with this pedal is actually two cables with weird connectors in the middle. I cut the connectors off of the cable and soldered the two sections together to make an even longer cable. I also applied heat shrink tubing. Then I torched it to shrink it. \n \n Locate your USB socket. Of course, you could solder a mini-USB cable right on the end, but that\u2019s not as nice as having a socket and being able to use different USB cables. \n \n Cut the end off.

I am working to understand the technology at a fundamental level \u2013 my interest is in the optical side of Kinect. My ultimate goal is to make the sensor nearsighted, so that the depth resolution can be used to scan small objects. The first step in understanding a technology is to look at it \u2014 that\u2019s why teardowns like this one at iFixit are so important. \n Unfortunately for us humans the Kinect projector is infrared (or near-infrared) \u2014 probably somewhere between 900 and 1020nm. My guess is that it\u2019s around 904nm, because it\u2019s cheap to produce those lasers, but that\u2019s just a guess; I haven\u2019t measured anything yet. That means that by design, we can\u2019t see the projection directly with our eyes. But we can see it with a camera. Almost all CMOS sensors in digital cameras ARE sensitive to infrared. In fact, they are so sensitive that there is a filter placed between the lens and the sensor to prevent IR from messing up your pictures. It\u2019s called the IR cutoff filter. \n The IR cutoff filter is easily identifiable. It\u2019s a bluish piece of glass. It\u2019s blue because the glass absorbs wavelengths that are just longer than red. This is an IR cutoff filter from an old video camera, you can clearly see how the filter just sits on top of the sensor: \n \n Here\u2019s the IR cutoff filter in my Sony NEX-5: \n \n These filters are so effective in reflecting and/or absorbing IR that the reflected IR has been used to detect cameras in dark theaters ! Yet another effective anti-piracy strategy\u2026 I see it\u2019s been steadily declining since that was published in 2004. \n Anyway, we need an IR sensitive camera to see what the hell is going on. I\u2019d rather not use a cheap IR security cam \u2014 the resolution is just too low. And I\u2019m not going to modify my NEX-5 for infrared (yet \u2013 but see Pete Ganzel\u2019s excellent work on that! ). So I\u2019ll have to compromise and pick what is probably the most difficult option: modifying a compact Powershot camera. It\u2019s difficult, because the filter in a compact camera is INSIDE a closed lens mechanism, and the camera was never designed to be disassembled. This tutorial will be a little incomplete, but should be enough to get any motivated person done with the same project. As all hackers know, it only takes one person to get the work done and share the results. \n Start with a clean workspace. Like this one. \n \n Disassemble the camera screw by screw. Don\u2019t miss the hidden one inside the battery compartment. \n \n Carefully pull the body apart: \n \n The back will come off first. It may be blurry. Don\u2019t let that bother you: \n \n Next, the front: \n \n Remove the display by removing the screw at the top left and unclipping these metal clips: \n \n Next, carefully unclip the FFC (Flat Flexible Cables) from their mounts. Some will be pull-out, and some will have a brown plastic clip that must be flipped up to release the cable. The display will come free, but it will be embarrassed and hide from the camera. \n \n Remove the keypad assembly, and unscrew all screws holding in the mainboard. Unfortunately, for the Powershot A540, I also had to unsolder this red and black wire which supply power to the flash. Since I hate the flash, and the camera is not dependent on it, I simply removed it for good. An IR cam has little use for a flash. Good riddance. \n \n Under the mainboard, you can see the back of the sensor. There is a bit of hot glue on a metal plate which is supported by three screws. This is the sensor assembly; it is our target. Now, before I go much further, I need to say that the camera will be difficult to return to normal operation. The IR filter must be destroyed to get it out. This forever changes the focal characteristics of the camera unless it is replaced with flat glass (and I\u2019m not doing that). So adjust your expectations of how perfectly the camera will focus from here on out, and all will be well. \nRemove the mainboard. \n \n Here is a better shot of the sensor assembly. The three screws are covered in hot glue. That is because next to each screw, there is a small spring which pushes up on the sensor assembly. In other words, it\u2019s a little 3-way platform that the sensor is adjusted on. The exact position is fixed because it was calibrated at the factory for perfect focus. We are going to destroy that by removing all three screws very slowly. Slowly, because the three springs will pop out if we move too quickly. \n \n Remove the three screws. Lift the sensor assembly free. Springs are visible. \n \n Well, there it is. The IR cut filter, held in by two dabs of hot glue. Try to lift it with a small screwdriver or hobby knife. It will most likely break because it is very thin. Remove the little pieces. Admire their lovely blue hue. \n \n Now comes the really hard part \u2014 you have to put the camera back together. I did so without the flash assembly in place, and I left a few screws out. My Dad taught me how to take things apart, and how to re-assemble them. He always called these \u201cextra\u201d screws \u201cshipping screws\u201d. Here are the shipping screws left out of this camera: \n \n Alright! I\u2019ve completed the very first tool in my Kinect hacking suite, a camera to look at the Kinect\u2019s pattern. But the question is: Was all this worth it? Does this really tell us anything? See for yourself: \n Before the infrared modification: \n \n After the infrared modification: \n \n Alright, looking good! Let\u2019s make a movie: \n \n This is kickass! Here\u2019s what the sensor output looks like up close \u2014 this board is about .5M away from the camera (click for full resolution, slightly misfocused \u2013 this image is public domain \u2013 I make no claim to copy rights): \n \n It\u2019s interesting in a few different ways. One can easily see that the Kinect IR speckle-field is a 3\u00d73 matrix of random dots. One can also see that they are differentiated by intensity and have a centered registration dot. So it is not purely random speckle. \n IR cameras are good for more than Kinect hacking. Here are a few outdoor shots showing some IR effects. \n \n \n Stay tuned as I build up a proper toolset for optical analysis and decipher just how these guys are using speckle to estimate depth."], "link": "http://www.futurepicture.org/?p=97", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://hackaday.com/": 1, "http://www.wired.com/": 1, "http://www.pbase.com/": 1, "http://www.ifixit.com/": 1, "http://en.wikipedia.org/": 1, "http://www.futurepicture.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "FUTUREPICTURE"}, {"content": ["This is what happens when you blend 64 images instead of 12: a much better looking composite. \n  \n Sorry for the silence \u2014 things will be picking up shortly."], "link": "http://www.futurepicture.org/?p=95", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.futurepicture.org/": 1}, "blogtitle": "FUTUREPICTURE"}, {"content": ["Matti has a new version of LFManip up .
