[{"blogurl": "http://engineering-returns.com\n", "blogroll": [], "title": "Engineering Returns"}, {"content": [". \n Portfolio Trader started 6th of September 2011.\u00a0With this post I want to share my performance review of the first \u00a0seven month. Typically seven month isn\u2019t enough time to fully judge the performance of a trading system. However I feel ok sharing it now as we have been going through a few distinct market types (strong bull, sideways and high volatility). \n \n A few facts upfront \n \n Results reported are 100% out-of-sample \n Every entry/exit has been published prior market open first trading day of the week. \n All trades are executed market-on-open. \n Results include a trading fee of 0.01$ / share. \n \n \n Performance \n  \n \n Learning and improvements \n A key benefit of Portfolio Trader is it\u2019s continues development and innovation. \u00a0Let me share a few of these improvements I\u2019ve made over the course of the past period: \n \n In Q4 / 2011 we saw some volatile weeks. The system changed position too quickly in such a volatile environment. \n=> Now the ranking calculation is taking into account given market volatility. \n . \n Starting Portfolio Trader I had two systems trading stocks. One was trading mean-reversion and the other momentum. \n=> Those are now combined into one system gradually switching between mean-reversion and momentum depending on the market condition. \n . \n Consistency vs. \u00a0high returns. A system developer has to make a number of crucial choices during the design process. In the past I\u2019ve been\u00a0focused\u00a0too much on archiving high absolute returns. \u00a0For executing a system\u00a0consistent steady profits are more important than absolute profits. \n=> I\u2019ve reviewed and adjusted my trading systems\u00a0given that crucial learning. \n \n Expectations \n I\u2019m ok with the performance of the past period. But way more important than performance is what I\u2019ve learned and CHANGED. These changes should also positively impact the performance going forward.\u00a0The most profitable trades\u00a0occur\u00a0at times when you don\u2019t expect them. So building confidence in order to push the button when it\u2019s needed (and most difficult) is a crucial element in order to succeed. \n FREE trial \n Should you be interested in Portfolio Trader then sign-up for a free trial here . \n Past weekly reports from 2012 \n \n 2012 / 18 \n 2012 / 17 \n 2012 / 16 \n 2012 / 15 \n 2012 / 14 \n 2012 / 13 \n 2012 / 12 \n 2012 / 11 \n 2012 / 10 \n 2012 / 09 \n 2012 / 08 \n 2012 / 07 \n 2012 / 06 \n 2012 / 05 \n 2012 / 04 \n 2012 / 03 \n 2012 / 02 \n 2012 / 01 \n \n List of all trades \n \n 2012 \n 2011"], "link": "http://engineering-returns.com/2012/04/28/portfolio-trader-review-sept-6th-2011-april-27th-2012/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://engineeringreturns.wordpress.com/": 2, "http://engineering-returns.com/": 21}, "blogtitle": "Engineering Returns"}, {"content": ["Summary \n Last week\u2019s call worked out partially.

That\u2019s because most markets go down together, hence correlation is rising among the various markets and asset classes. Conventional market wisdom says: high correlation among markets and assets classes is a sign of fear. \u00a0But what about the opposite? \u00a0So I wanted to understand if conventional wisdom is right and what short-term impact correlation has on the US stock market and how to use this in my trading. \n \n Background \n \n SPY is used as a proxy to trade the US stock market. \n Data is adjusted for cash dividends and splits \n Tests don\u2019t consider trading cost / slippage \n History: January 1993 \u2013 February 2012 \n \n I calculated correlation among all SP500 members ( survivorship bias free ) \u00a0using daily bars. The calculation is conducted after the last trading day of the week has finished, that\u2019s most likely Friday. The actual trade is taken the next day @OPEN, that\u2019s most likely Monday. The trade is then held until next week (Monday). No other stops \u00a0or exists are used. \n In the second column of each test you find a benchmark value. That is the strategy as described until here without any filter or market timing components. So we end up with almost 1000 trades, hence the benchmark strategy is 100% invested. The following columns show weekly returns (=weekly trades) under different correlation conditions. \n Test 1: Looking at absolute correlation levels \n  \n The test is dividing the correlation\u00a0measure\u00a0into quartiles.\u00a0We see very little difference among the first two buckets where the market is in 90+% of the time.\u00a0Though high (peak ) correlation has a positive impact on next week\u2019s performance. \n \n Test 2: Higher or lower correlation \n  \n For this test we look into falling or rising correlation regardless of it\u2019s absolute level. Friday\u2019s level \u00a0compared to previous day (t-1) or five days ago (t-5). \u00a0There is a significant\u00a0difference in performance and risk adjusted\u00a0measures. \n Weeks after falling correlation are way better than weeks after rising correlation! \n \n Test 3: Using relative strength or weakness \n  \n In the final test we look at the RSI2 level of the average market correlation. RSI2 has the advantage that it\u2019s less binary compared to looking at absolute changes to previous days.\u00a0I think the results are outstanding! Being invested in weeks after RSI2 is bellow 25 delivered higher returns than the benchmark strategy while only being invested 38% of the time. Furthermore volatility is reduced\u00a0significantly. The benchmark strategy had a max. drawdown of about 55% while the RSI2<25 strategy had \u00a021% only. \n \n A picture says more than thousands word \n Now the pessimists among us might ask if this is time stable? \n  \n \n Let me know what YOU think about this test or how YOU use correlation in your trading. \n \n This post is based on research that I\u2019ve turned into an important component of my Portfolio Trader trading systems.
