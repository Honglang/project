His letter offers advice to scholars about how to address the situation: Find out the truth through extensive replication and announce it. \n The text of the letter is below: \n From: Daniel Kahneman \nSent: Wednesday, September 26, 2012 9:32 AM \nSubject: A proposal to deal with questions about priming effects \n Dear colleagues, \n I write this letter to a collection of people who were described to me (mostly by John Bargh) as students of social priming. There were names on the list that I could not match to an email. Please pass it on to anyone else you think might be relevant. \n As all of you know, of course, questions have been raised about the robustness of priming results. The storm of doubts is fed by several sources, including the recent exposure of fraudulent researchers, general concerns with replicability that affect many disciplines, multiple reported failures to replicate salient results in the priming literature, and the growing belief in the existence of a pervasive file drawer problem that undermines two methodological pillars of your field: the preference for conceptual over literal replication and the use of meta-analysis. Objective observers will point out that the problem could well be more severe in your field than in other branches of experimental psychology, because every priming study involves the invention of a new experimental situation. \n For all these reasons, right or wrong, your field is now the poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research. Your problem is not with the few people who have actively challenged the validity of some priming results. It is with the much larger population of colleagues who in the past accepted your surprising results as facts when they were published. These people have now attached a question mark to the field, and it is your responsibility to remove it. \n I am not a member of your community, and all I have personally at stake is that I recently wrote a book that emphasizes priming research as a new approach to the study of associative memory \u2013 the core of what dual-system theorists call System 1. Count me as a general believer. I also believe in a point that John Bargh made in his response to Cleeremans, that priming effects are subtle and that their design requires high-level skills. I am skeptical about replications by investigators new to priming research, who may not be attuned to the subtlety of the conditions under which priming effects are observed, or to the ease with which these effects can be undermined. \n My reason for writing this letter is that I see a train wreck looming. I expect the first victims to be young people on the job market. Being associated with a controversial and suspicious field will put them at a severe disadvantage in the competition for positions. Because of the high visibility of the issue, you may already expect the coming crop of graduates to encounter problems. Another reason for writing is that I am old enough to remember two fields that went into a prolonged eclipse after similar outsider attacks on the replicability of findings: subliminal perception and dissonance reduction. \n I believe that you should collectively do something about this mess. To deal effectively with the doubts you should acknowledge their existence and confront them straight on, because a posture of defiant denial is self-defeating. Specifically, I believe that you should have an association, with a board that might include prominent social psychologists from other field. The first mission of the board would be to organize an effort to examine the replicability of priming results, following a protocol that avoids the questions that have been raised and guarantees credibility among colleagues outside the field. \n The following is just an example of such a protocol: \n* Assemble a group of five labs, where the leading investigators have an established reputation (tenure should perhaps be a requirement). Substantial labs with several students are the most desirable participants. \n* Each lab selects a recent demonstration of a priming effect, which they consider robust and most likely to replicate. \n* The board makes a public commitment to these five specific effects \n* Set up a daisy chain of labs A-B-C-D-E-A, where each lab will replicate the study selected by its neighbor: B replicates A, C replicates B etc. \n* Have the replicating lab send someone to see how subjects are run (hence the emphasis on recency \u2013 the experiments should be in the active repertoire of the original lab, so that additional subjects can be run with confidence that the same procedure is followed). \n* Have the replicated lab send someone to vet the procedure of the replicating lab as it starts its work \n* Run enough subjects to guarantee power (probably more than in the original study) \n* Use technology (e.g. video) to ensure that every detail of the method is documented and can be copied by others. \n* Pre-commit to publish the results, letting the chips fall where they may, and make all data available for analysis by others. \n This is something you could do quickly, and relatively cheaply. The main costs are 10 trips, and funds to cover these costs would be easy to get (I have checked). You would have to be careful in selecting laboratories and results to maximize credibility, and every step of the procedure should be open and documented. The unusually high openness to scrutiny may be annoying and even offensive, but it is a small price to pay for the big prize of restored credibility. \n Success (say, replication of four of the five positive priming results) would immediately rehabilitate the field. Importantly, success would also provide an effective challenge to the adequacy of outsiders\u2019 replications. A publicly announced and open effort would be credible among colleagues at large, because it would show that you are sufficiently confident in your results to take a risk. \n More ambiguous results would be painful, of course, but they would still protect the reputations of scholars who sincerely believe in their work \u2013 even if they are sometimes wrong. \n The protocol I outlined is just an example of something you might do. The main point of my letter is that you should do something, and that you must do it collectively. No single individual will be able to overcome the doubts, but if you act as a group and avoid defensiveness you will be credible. \n In response to Ed Yong\u2019s article in Nature in which Kahneman\u2019s letter is published, Norbert Schwarz, has written a response , saying \u201cThere is no empirical evidence that work in this area is more or less replicable than work in other areas.\u201d \n REFERENCE \n Nobel laureate challenges psychologists to clean up their act"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DecisionScienceNews/~3/Dv3LhcaNZ-A/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"https://docs.google.com/": 1, "http://www.nature.com/": 1, "http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/": 1, "http://feedads.doubleclick.net/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Decision Science News"}, {"content": ["PROFESSORSHIPS IN OPERATIONS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA \n \n  \n The Operations and Information Management Department at the Wharton School is home to faculty with a diverse set of interests in decision-making, information technology, information-based strategy, operations management, and operations research.\u00a0 We are seeking applicants for a full-time, tenure-track faculty position at any level: Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor.

William Batchelder has written (for the Society for Mathematical Psychology) the following biography of Duncan Luce\u2019s intellectual contributions: \n FACETS OF DUNCAN LUCE\u2019S RESEARCH CAREER \nDuncan Luce (1925-2012) was one of the pioneers in establishing mathematical psychology as a field of study. It is arguable that without Duncan\u2019s leadership, intellect, and scholarly skills, the field would not have existed. He was the main force behind the publication of the two readings volumes and the three handbook volumes in mathematical psychology edited by Luce, Robert Bush, and Eugene Galanter from 1963-65. These five books together served to define our field. Later, he played a crucial role in starting our flagship journal, the Journal of Mathematical Psychology, as well as our Society. While everyone in the Society for Mathematical Psychology knows about Duncan and some aspects of his work, there are facets of his work that many members may be unaware of. The main purpose of this note is to celebrate Duncan\u2019s work by focusing on a few of these facets. \nDuncan received his PhD in Mathematics at M.I.T. in 1950. His thesis was titled \u201cOn Semigroups,\u201d an area in abstract algebra. His earliest work in the social and behavioral sciences was in the area now called social networks. In his very first paper, published in 1949 with A. D. Perry, he mathematically defined the concept of clique and exploited the idea of representing graphs in matrix form, where matrix manipulations could be used to reveal the structure in a graph. This approach to analyzing graphic structures has become standard in the field of computer science, an area that hardly existed at the time of Duncan\u2019s early work. \nDuncan\u2019s first academic position was as co-director of a network laboratory at M.I.T. from 1950-53, and his first tenure track position was as an Assistant Professor of Mathematical Statistics and Sociology at Columbia University (1954-57). It was in this period that Duncan acquired his lifelong interest in decision theory, and his 1957 book with Howard Raiffa, Games and Decisions: Introduction and Critical Survey, has become a classic in the economic sciences. \nPerhaps the earliest hint of his future interest in psychology is seen in a paper with L. S. Christie in 1956 titled \u201cDecision structure and time relations in simple choice behavior.\u201d This paper foreshadowed the publication of Duncan\u2019s well-received book, Response Times, published 30 years later. Apart from this 1956 paper almost all his early work was in the areas of social structure and decision theory, areas well outside of psychology at that time. \nIn 1959 Duncan published a very influential book, Individual Choice Behavior: A Theoretical Analysis. It is in this small book with a red cover that Luce\u2019s choice axiom is proposed. One consequence of the choice axiom is the so-called ratio rule, namely if several possible choice alternatives have positive valued strengths, then the probability of any one of them being selected is its strength divided by the sum of the strengths of all the other available alternatives. The ratio rule has been employed by a number of cognitive modelers in moving from latent representations of response strengths into actual manifest responses. It is perhaps ironic that the ratio rule is only a small consequence of Luce\u2019s choice axiom, which also includes the case where one or more of the choice alternatives has zero strength in certain contexts. In fact, his book explores the consequences of the choice axiom in many areas including paired-comparison scaling, Fechnerian scaling, signal detection, utility theory, and learning theory. \nThe style of the 1959 book, like almost all of Duncan\u2019s work, is to proceed rationally with definitions, axioms, theorems, and proofs. The primary goal is to make progress by discovering the consequences of simple, non-trivial assumptions, rather than, say, inventing complex hypothetical structures with the primary goal of fitting data. Nevertheless, in all cases the aim of Duncan\u2019s work is to discover the testable consequences of one\u2019s assumptions. Duncan did not pose the choice axiom as the \u2018correct theory\u2019 of choice behavior. Instead, it was intentionally posed as an elegantly simple theory with many surprising consequences. Then when some choice phenomena is found not to satisfy the consequences of the choice axiom, it is often clear exactly what aspects of the axioms are in need of elaboration. Indeed, later work by others on choice theory has worked in the important concepts of item similarity, context effects, and time to respond that were intentionally missing from the choice axiom. \nIn 1959, Duncan published another classic work, \u201cOn the possible psychophysical laws.\u201d In it he shows that given only knowledge of the scale type (ratio, interval, etc.) of an independent and dependent variable, one can determine the possible functional forms relating the two variables that are invariant under permissible scale transformations. That paper was not without controversy, because in many scientific laws there are dimension-absorbing constants that free up possible functional forms and thus delimit the applicability of Duncan\u2019s results. Nevertheless, the 1959 paper was seminal in directing his interest to dimension analysis, an area associated at that time with mathematical physics. This interest in dimensional analysis was one of the strands that lead to Duncan\u2019s long-term interest in the foundations of measurement discussed later. \nIn addition to the axiomatic/theorem approach, the 1959 paper on psychophysical scales reveals another hallmark of Duncan\u2019s approach to formal theory. The idea is that a theory formulated by empirically motivated axioms can give rise to functional equations whose solution provides the possible functional relationships between theoretical and behavioral variables. The solutions to these equations can suggest experiments that have the potential to falsify the theory, and if falsified one can look at specific axioms for what went wrong and how to fix it. In Duncan\u2019s later efforts to exploit this approach to theory construction, others assisted him, including the mathematician J\u00e1nos Acz\u00e9l, perhaps the World\u2019s most respected solver of functional equations. \nFoundations of measurement became a central topic of Duncan\u2019s research from the middle 1960s up to the publication of the second and third volumes of the Foundations of Measurement in 1990, with Patrick Suppes, David Krantz, and Amos Tversky. In addition to the co-authors of the three foundational volumes, other mathematically savvy colleagues such as Louis Narens, Jean-Claude Falmagne, and Tony Marley joined him in this monumental effort. The thrust of the work was more directed to philosophy of science rather than to psychology. For this reason, the approach was mostly concerned with finding proper axiomatic formulations in idealized, error free settings rather than in more realistic settings involving measurement error. Despite the lack of concern with measurement error, some of the axiomatic work in foundations has been very influential in psychology such as Duncan\u2019s 1964 paper with the statistician John Tukey on conjoint measurement. This paper has guided experimental psychologists to more carefully regard the hypothesis of an interaction between experimental variables. \nMuch of Duncan\u2019s more empirical work was in the areas of psychophysics, with a special interest in acoustics. This work started in the middle 1960s, and much of it was carried out with his close association with David M. Green. Green\u2019s active acoustics laboratory and Duncan\u2019s mathematical ideas gave rise to some influential theoretical papers such as his 1972 paper with Green, \u201c A neural timing theory for response times and the psychophysics of intensity.\u201d Somewhat uncharacteristically for Duncan, he published an undergraduate text, \u201cSound and Hearing,\u201d in 1993, based on a course he developed at Harvard. I am certain many of us can understand how difficult it must have been for Duncan to find things to teach at the undergraduate level in an American university. \nIn his last ten years, Duncan published over fifty papers, and in these papers all the themes discussed above were represented many times over. Much of this work was coauthored with others mentioned earlier, and some of it was greatly assisted on the empirical side by his research association with Ragnar Steingrimsson. \n William H.
