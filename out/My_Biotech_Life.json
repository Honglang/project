Not a usual thing for me but here it goes, nonetheless. \n \nOne of these weekends, I was trolling around the interwebs and came across a post by someone with a hypothetical (far-fetched) question along the lines of: \u201cWhat would you do if you suddenly discovered that you could not die?\u201d \n Quite immediately the silly and equally far-fetched comments/answers started coming in. Some would do such things as walk into volcanoes, leap from buildings/planes and perform other generally mortal activities. However, others took a more cautious route by stating that they would not tell anyone for fear of scientific probing or media exposure. The answers said quite a bit about each commenter\u2019s personalities, to say the least. \n However, what I found most interesting were the follow-up questions to the original question.

Rambling a bit more, the answers to the various questions asked after the original question would further define my answer and therefore lead to a more specific hypothetical answer. \n In short, if you had to answer the question above, would you answer as is or attempt to find out more about the hypothetical situation before answering? \n I guess the easiest (and probably lamest ) answer is \u201cIt depends.\u201d \n The questions to the hypothetical question"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MyBiotechLife/~3/dOAbD-HuTzM/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://my.biotechlife.net/": 1, "http://www.flickr.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "My Biotech Life"}, {"content": ["I have a special interest in most things that sit at the interface of art and science . Be it, graphic design through data visualizations , fancy portraits of your DNA or just geeky hand-made jewelery , it\u2019s all good in my books. \n A couple (6?!) months ago I was contacted by Alexandra Pajak, a graduate student from the University of Georgia, with an interesting project. She told me that she was working an album based on the genome of the HIV virus called Sounds of HIV . It immediately caught my attention and I said I\u2019d love to give it a listen. \n Sounds of HIV is a musical translation of the genetic code of HIV, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Every segment of the virus is assigned musical pitches that correspond to the segment\u2019s scientific properties. In this way, the sounds reflect the true nature of the virus. When listening from beginning to end, the listener hears the entire genome of HIV. \n So how does one listen to DNA, RNA or proteins you ask? It\u2019s somewhat explained by Alexandra\u2019s notes: \n DNA-based music is music in which the natural chemical properties of DNA is translated into music. In English, the nucleotides adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine are abbreviated with the letters a, c, t, and g, respectively. Since A, C, and G are also musical pitches in the Western melodic scale, these pitches were assigned to the matching nucleotides. To form two perfect fifths (C-G and D-A), \u201cD\u201d was arbitrarily assigned to musically represent thymine. The notes of the A minor scale have been assigned to the amino acids based on their level of attraction to water. \n \n On Sounds of HIV, depending on the track, nucleotides and/or amino acids \u201cplay\u201d as music. Tracks 1 and 10 are based on the first and last nucleotides of the DNA chain. Tracks 2-9 \u201cplay\u201d the proteins and sometimes the nucleotides on top of the proteins. \n \n I\u2019ve listened to the full album and have found it to be a bit strange at times but was mostly expecting the music to very different as it is in fact driven by genetic information which most probably didn\u2019t evolve based on it\u2019s audible features! \nYou can listen to excerpts at Amazon and if you like what you hear, be sure to buy a copy as a part of the proceeds from the sale of this album will go to the Emory Vaccine Center which does extensive AIDS research. \n Sounds of HIV \u2013 From nucleotides to notes"], "link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MyBiotechLife/~3/Vf-yHM0ZOEk/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://my.biotechlife.net/": 3, "http://www.amazon.com/": 3, "http://dna11.com/": 1, "http://www.madewithmolecules.com/": 1, "http://www.emory.edu/": 1}, "blogtitle": "My Biotech Life"}, {"content": ["Keeping my pledge to write a short blog post about an outstanding woman in science for Ada Lovelace Day , I have chosen the curious little sister of the famous astronomer Sir William Herschel .

Not only did she entertain guests, keep the house, sing and care for her sibling, she also fell in love with the stars as she accompanied her brother on his many nightly scans. \n Considering all the chores, the singing lessons and the long nights, she played a big part in her brothers success and even got her name immortalized on an asteroid.

Thus my choice. \n I could have easily mentioned another more famous and generally known female scientist, but I enjoyed learning about her life and thought it would be interesting to share the fact that there was a great woman doing incredible work in astronomy.
