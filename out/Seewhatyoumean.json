Doodling, or creating rich pictures as we call it, is a sure-fire way to open up discussion and encourage participation. Ideas can be complex, and words are exact. People will argue about their meaning and lose sight of the bigger picture. As John Heggarty said \u2018words are a barrier to communication\u2019. Pictures are more immediate, universal, and most importantly they carry emotion. When you tell someone a story, or show them a sketch plan, they\u2019re much more likely to become engaged and say \u2018I see what you mean\u2019. We\u2019ve been developing rich pictures for many years for top companies including BBC Worldwide, Capgemini, Cognizant, Gartner, KPMG and Shell. We use this doodling style to gain a profound understanding of your company or ideas. But it\u2019s much more than just doodling to record what\u2019s said. It\u2019s the discussion and challenging of ideas. The dialogue moves the group\u2019s common understanding along quickly towards agreement. But to leave it as a set of sketchnotes is less than half the job. The ideas need to be distilled and restructured, to create a picture - a journey that resonates. And then it has to be presented; unfolded by a \u2018human\u2019, in a conversational way. Left alone, a viewer will guess at the story and the meanings. You are the guide, the storyteller to bring the picture to life. As the viewer watches and listens, the insight in the picture becomes clear, and it helps to keep the whole story in mind. As we say, \u2018it\u2019s your whole business on one page\u2019. Clients really value the clarity this process brings. It\u2019s been described as \u2018almost magic\u2019 and \u2018genius!\u2019. Take a look at some case studies on seewhatyoumean.co.uk and check out what our client\u2019s say about it.
