We will study modern techniques for computers to represent task-relevant information and make intelligent (i.e. satisfying or optimal) decisions towards the achievement of goals. The search and problem solving methods are applicable throughout a large range of industrial, civil, medical, financial, robotic, and information systems. We will investigate questions about AI systems such as: how to represent knowledge, how to effectively generate appropriate sequences of actions and how to search among alternatives to find optimal or near-optimal solutions. We will also explore how to deal with uncertainty in the world, how to learn from experience, and how to learn decision rules from data. We expect that by the end of the course students will have a thorough understanding of the algorithmic foundations of AI, how probability and AI are closely interrelated, and how automated agents learn. We also expect students to acquire a strong appreciation of the big-picture aspects of developing fully autonomous intelligent agents. Other lectures will introduce additional aspects of AI, including unsupervised and on-line learning, autonomous robotics, and economic/game-theoretic decision making. \n Learning Objectives \n By the end of the course, students should be able to: \n \n Identify the type of an AI problem (search, inference, decision making under uncertainty, game theory, etc). \n Formulate the problem as a particular type. (Example: define a state space for a search problem) \n Compare the difficulty of different versions of AI problems, in terms of computational complexity and the efficiency of existing algorithms. \n Implement, evaluate and compare the performance of various AI algorithms. Evaluation could include empirical demonstration or theoretical proofs. \n \n Textbook: \n It is helpful, but not required, to have Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach / Russel and Norvig. \n Judging from the materials on the website, this is a very good course."], "link": "http://tm.durusau.net/?p=32608", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.cmu.edu/": 1, "http://aima.berkeley.edu/": 1, "http://dblp.uni-trier.de/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Another Word For It"}, {"content": ["Building apps with rail data by Jamie Andrews. \n From the post: \n Recently we ran a hack day Off the Rails to take the best rail data and see what can be built with it.

A person is not one-dimensional; they can be a parent, a friend, a colleague and each has different motivations and requirements depending on the environment. A product is as much about the physical aspect as it is the pricing, message, and sales channel it is sold through. Or, it is also faceted by the fact that it is put together from various products and parts from partners. In no way is a master entity unique or has a consistency depending on what is important about the entity in a given situation. What MDM provides are definitions and instructions on the right data to use in the right engagement. Context is a key value of MDM. \n When organizations have implemented MDM to create a golden record and single source of truth, domain models are extremely rigid and defined only within a single engagement model for a process or reporting. The challenge is the master entity is global in nature when it should have been localized. This model does not allow enough points of relationship to create the dimensions needed to extend beyond the initial scope. If you want to now extend, you need to rebuild your MDM model. This is essentially starting over or you ignore and build a layer of redundancy and introduce more complexity and management. \n The line: \n The challenge is the master entity is global in nature when it should have been localized. \n stopped me cold. \n What if I said: \n \u201cThe challenge is a subject proxy is global in nature when it should have been localized.\u201d \n Would your reaction be the same? \n Shouldn\u2019t subject identity always be local? \n Or perhaps better, have you ever experienced a subject identification that wasn\u2019t local? \n We may talk about a universal notion of subject but even so we are using a localized definition of universal subject. \n If a subject proxy is a container for local identifications, thought to be identifications of the same subject, need we be concerned if it doesn\u2019t claim to be a universal representative for some subject? Or is it sufficient that it is a faithful representative of one or more identifications, thought by some collector to identify the same subject? \n I am leaning towards the latter because it jettisons the doubtful baggage of universality. \n That is a subject may have more than one collection of local identifications (such collections being subject proxies), none of which is the universal representative for that subject. \n Even if we think another collection represents the same subject, merging those collections is a question of your requirements. \n You may not want to collect Twitter comments in Hindi about Glee . \n Your topic map, your requirements, your call. \n PS: You need to read Michele\u2019s original post to discover what could entice management to fund an MDM project.
