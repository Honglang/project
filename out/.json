Times headlined something most of us have experienced personally: Sleep well, or face the possibility of eating poorly. But the \u201cnews\u201d in the news story was that someone used an fMRI to measure brain patterns of people while deciding what they would like to eat. As the L.A. Times put it, \u201cThe study is looking at the neural systems of the brain to see how they affect the decisions made.\u201c \n The problem is that the neural systems may not \u201caffect\u201d the decisions made, but rather \u201creflect\u201d the decisions made. Or, actually, the neural patterns may reflect how a tired versus a non-tired person thinks about food, regardless of which food they choose. From a detailed report on the abstract , one can see that the fMRI research suggested that, among tired people choosing foods, the frontal lobes (long associated with reasoning) reflected differences between people who had slept and those who hadn\u2019t, but the regions traditionally associated with \u201creward reactivity\u201d did not. \n What does it all mean? It could be, as the L.A. Times suggested, that the brain\u2019s functioning is impaired, leading us to make bad decisions. It could also be that sleep deprivation leads to poorer functioning of this region of the brain, but there could be other physical explanations for the desires of people to eat less healthy food when tired other than our failure \u201cto integrate all the different signals that help us normally make wise choices about what we should eat,\u201d (as the lead author, Stephanie Greer, a graduate student at UC Berkeley, put it). These could be changes in our energy needs, which result in specific regions of the brain reacting to those needs. \n None of this changes the well-known result that sleeping less leads to eating more, and eating less healthily.

That\u2019s what democracy is all about. The old idea of \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d is not there in Europe at the moment.\u201d \n He goes on to say that the views of the electorate in southern European countries such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain have counted for less than those of \n \u201cthe bankers, the rating agencies and the financial institutions.\u00a0 One result of European monetary integration, without a political integration, is that the population of many of these countries has no voice. Economics is de-linked from the political base. That I think is a mistake and it goes completely against the big European movement that began in the 40s and fostered the idea of a democratic, united Europe.\u201d \n Certainly Sen is right to note that that there is a \u201cdemocratic failure\u201d in the EU.\u00a0 This problem, more commonly referred to as a \u201cdemocratic deficit,\u201d is an enduring one in European politics. \n In 2005, within three days of each other, the electorates of both France and the Netherlands soundly rejected the Maastricht Treaty, which had been signed in 1992 with the hope that it would \u201ctransfer sovereignty to Brussels,\u201d in the words of one Dutch supporter of the EU .\u00a0 What made these particular rejections sting was that France and the Netherlands were two of the original six members of the European Economic Community, the forerunner to the E.U. \n However, the double rejection of Maastricht had no effect upon the functioning of the E.U., since the operative attitude of leaders in Brussels is to recognize the outcomes of democratic votes only when they are the \u201ccorrect\u201d ones.\u00a0 Indeed, most of the decisions to ratify various E.U. agreements have been made, not by voters in individual countries, but by parliaments, with little or no consultation of the people whose lives would be affected by the loss of sovereignty E.U. membership implies. \n Indeed, in 2008, the voters of Ireland, perhaps inspired by those of France and the Netherlands, rejected another piece of E.U. legislation, the Lisbon Treaty. \u00a0 After that defeat the government of Ireland obtained a number of political concessions from the E.U., including the right to have an Irish representative on the European Commission and agreements on taxation and social issues.\u00a0 In return the government held another referendum the following year, and the Treaty passed.\u00a0 However, the impression remains that the Irish and E.U. elites did not like the first result, so they allowed the electorate to try again, until they got it right. \n Amartya Sen is correct to state that there has been a \u201cdemocratic failure\u201d in the E.U. and that it is largely the result of the lack of the political integration that would allow greater economic harmony throughout the Eurozone.\u00a0 One of the main causes of the current crisis in Europe is that economies as different as those of Germany and Greece are lashed together, preventing a country with severe economic problems such as Greece to devalue its currency, restructure its debt, and begin the long struggle to restore its economy. \n Only a true political union on the Continent would have allowed a harmonization of monetary, tax, interest-rate, and labor policies to prevent the simmering crises in Greece, Portugal, and Spain.\u00a0 But European leaders knew that they would have had to make such a union transparent to voters, who see themselves as Germans, Greeks, and Spaniards, not as \u201cEuropeans,\u201d and they knew that they could never win such votes throughout the E.U.\u00a0 Thus, they attempted to impose a de facto political integration by stealth, but the failure of that path has been obvious for many months."], "link":

earlier this year by the World Bank indicate that for the first time the number of people living in extreme poverty declined in every region of the developing world.\u00a0 Every three years the Bank examines economic progress in 130 developing countries as measured by spending power, and the most recent figures are for the period 2005-2008.\u00a0 Never before has extreme poverty been reduced in all of the regions of the developing world simultaneously.\u00a0 In 2008 22% of the world\u2019s population, or 1.29 billion people, lived below the poverty line, a significant decline from the 52% in 1981 or the 43% in 1990 that did so.\u00a0 As the leader of the team that compiled the data notes, \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c[t]he developing world has made remarkable progress in fighting extreme\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 poverty, and it has proved resilient to recent economic shocks and rising food and oil prices,\u201d \n To more accurately compare the cost of living across cultures, the World Bank used purchasing-power parity (PPP) as its yardstick, which measures the cost of a basket of goods from country to country. \u00a0Other methods of comparison can distort the actual cost of goods to consumers.\u00a0 For example, comparisons based on exchange rates do not account for local differences in price that are affected by factors such as domestic political decisions. \n Perhaps the best known example of PPP is the \u201cBig Mac Index,\u201d published every year by The Economist , which determines the prices of a McDonald\u2019s Big Mac in a variety of countries throughout the world and then compares them to the average American price.\u00a0 In its 2012 rankings , the magazine determined that Switzerland has the most overvalued burger (it costs $6.81, as compared with the American price of $4.20), while India \u2013 which for cultural reasons does not use beef in its burgers, but prefers chicken in its Maharaja Mac \u2013 is the most undervalued, costing a mere $1.62.\u00a0 As The Economist notes, PPP holds that over time the exchange rate of currencies ought to adjust to equal the cost of goods in different countries. \n A few important caveats need to be kept in mind.\u00a0 First, the figures in the World Bank report only go up to 2008.\u00a0 As it points out, data after 2008 from poorer countries is either hard to find or not comparable with previous estimates, but some preliminary data from 2010 do suggest that 2010 rates of extreme poverty are less than half those of 1990, which would mean that the Millennium Development Goal set by the United Nations in 2000 of cutting in half the worldwide poverty rate by 2015 has already been achieved.\u00a0 This result is even more remarkable given that the worldwide financial crisis reached its full force that year. \n It is also important to note that the extreme poverty rate as measured by the Bank is defined as $1.25 a day per person, hardly a large sum of money by developed countries\u2019 standards. \n Finally, a substantial portion of the improvement in East Asia since 1981 is due to economic changes in China and roughly coincides with the introduction of market-based reforms. \n Nevertheless, as Steve Chapman points out at Reason , the progress that has been made has been due to the dismantling of command economies in favor of free-market solutions. \n \u201cOver the past two decades, poorer nations have dismantled command-and-control methods and given markets greater latitude. Economic growth, not redistribution, has been the surest cure for poverty, and economic freedom has been the key that unlocked the riddle of economic growth.\u201d"], "link": "http://thestatsblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/world-bank-reports-decline-of-poverty-in-developing-nations-by-david-macneil-one-of-the-contributors-to-the-soon-to-be-launched-econostats-a-joint-project-between-stats-and-gmu/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.undp.org/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 7, "http://www.economist.com/": 1, "http://econ.worldbank.org/": 1, "http://reason.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": ""}, {"content": ["In unveiling its employment data for March , the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that 120,000 nonfarm jobs were added to the economy that month, with losses in retail jobs and construction offset by gains in manufacturing and food service and drinking places.\u00a0 As delighted as we are that more people are employed in bars across America, there are reasons to be less than enthusiastic about these numbers.\u00a0 Gains of 200,000 for the month had been anticipated, based on the numbers for the past half-year. \n In a sober assessment of the report , Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution suggested that these numbers are the bellwether of a slowing jobs picture in the coming months. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn sum, the March 2012 employment report shows little progress toward reaching full employment. The unemployment rate fell because fewer jobless workers were actively seeking a job, not because more Americans found one. The employer survey showed payroll gains of 120,000, but this is only slightly faster than the rate of job gain needed to keep up with the growth in the working-age population. After six months of robust job gains, a mediocre report in March may signal the start of slower improvements in the next few months.\u201d \n Likewise, Rea Hederman, Jr., of The Heritage Foundation, noting that there was a slight decrease in the unemployment rate from 8.3 to 8.2 percent, said that even this \u201creflected ill fortune, because it was due entirely to a marked shift of workers leaving the labor force instead of finding new jobs.\u201d \n The implications of these disappointing results are clear for the Obama administration.\u00a0 In January of 2009 the administration\u2019s economic team predicted that unemployment would peak at 8% in the third quarter of 2009 and decrease thereafter under the influence of the President\u2019s stimulus package.\u00a0 In fact, as

the Brookings Institution examined the economic recovery of America\u2019s 100 largest metropolitan areas during the last quarter of 2011, the latest for which figures are available.\u00a0 The news is, as they say, a mixed bag.\u00a0 Let\u2019s start with the good news: \n \n By December, 2011, the unemployment rate was lower in 93 out of 100 major metropolitan areas than it had been a year earlier. \u00a0 The unemployment rate was higher in six areas (Augusta, Chicago, Honolulu, Jackson, New York, and Raleigh) and was the same in one (Omaha). \n \n \n High-tech and auto-manufacturing centers have experienced particularly strong recoveries from the recession that began in 2007. \u00a0 Among the 20 metropolitan areas recording the strongest growth are those with information technology (Austin, Boise, Ogden, Portland [OR], Provo, San Jose) or biotechnology (Worcester) industries, as well as those that specialize in the manufacture of automobiles, auto parts, and related materials (Detroit, Grand Rapids, Toledo, Youngstown). \n \n \n Seventy out of 100 of the largest metropolitan areas showed growth in both jobs and output. \u00a0 Most of the remaining thirty, however, lost jobs but increased output. \n \n \n Of 100 metropolitan areas, 24 gained jobs in all four quarters of last year, including those in the Great Lakes region, in the Southwest, and in places with high-tech industries. \n \n \n But there\u2019s bad news, too: \n \n By December, 2011, the unemployment rate remained over 6 percent in all but 11 of 100 metropolitan areas. \u00a0 The 11 winners were:\u00a0 Omaha, Madison, Provo, Honolulu, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, Washington, Oklahoma City, Boston, Ogden, and Des Moines.\u00a0 Thirteen areas had unemployment rates between 10 and 15 percent, while three cities in California \u2014 Fresno, Modesto, and Stockton \u2013 had rates over 15 percent. \n \n \n Seventy-six of 100 metropolitan regions lost more jobs in the 16 quarters after the recession of 2007 than in the 16 quarters after previous recessions. \u00a0 In comparison, 16 quarters after the beginning of the 1981-82 recession, employment in the 100 largest metropolitan areas had grown by 8 percent. \n \n \n Only one out of four metropolitan areas gained back more than half the jobs they lost. \u00a0 The report compared the number of jobs these areas had at their peak between 2004 and 2009 and compared it to the number they lost once the recession began.\u00a0 Only 6 regained all of the jobs they lost, and 4 of those (Austin, El Paso, Houston, McAllen) were in Texas (the other two were Pittsburgh and Worcester). \n \n \n The recovery in manufacturing jobs slowed in Q4 of 2001. \u00a0 Throughout major metropolitan areas, the growth of manufacturing jobs decreased from 0.7 percent in Q2 to 0.2 in Q3, finally dropping to 0.02 in Q4.\u00a0 Ominously, while 72 out of 100 metropolitan areas had experienced manufacturing job growth during the first quarter of 2011, by the fourth quarter that number was only 46, a loss of over a third. \n \n An important subtext of the analysis is the role that government funds play in the recovery in various areas.\u00a0 As the report indicates, places with high-tech and automobile industries tended to do better than others, but these are industries most likely to receive federal grant funding (for high-tech firms) or TARP payments (General Motors and Chrysler together received $79 billion from the TARP fund). \n Also, the report notes that economic recovery has generally been strongest where growth in government jobs, including military jobs, has been greatest, while the loss of government jobs has coincided with weak recoveries.\u00a0 Even the most indispensable government jobs must be paid for through taxation, and the dollars that are spent on these cannot be invested in new private-sector jobs, cannot be used to start new businesses, and cannot be saved.\u00a0 Is the dependence of the recovery upon tax dollars removed from the private economy a good long-term investment for the American taxpayer?"], "link":
