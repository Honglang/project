So, this morning in class I taught\u00a0 an article \u00a0using the\u00a0 network scale-up method . It\u2019s a great technique that\u2019s been used to explore a number of interesting questions (e.g.,\u00a0 war casualties , and\u00a0 HIV/AIDS ). \n I came back from that class to\u00a0 this article \u00a0pointing to a debate on voter ID laws, and I couldn\u2019t help but think that there has to be a meaningful way to throw this method at this question to estimate plausible bounds for the actual potential impact of these laws. And furthermore, it seems especially important because people without IDs are likely quite hard to accurately enumerate on there own (as are those who\u2019ve engaged in voter fraud). \n So, has this study already been published and i just missed it? Else, does someone have the data we\u2019d need for that? I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a solved question, as i assume its something it would be better to have known a few months ago than a few weeks from now.

Instead, we\u2019d tend to load GDP/capita (or maybe log GDP/capita) into a regression equation, which thus implicitly assumes that all variation is meaningful, and that an extra $1000 is equally meaningful across the spectrum (or that a change of 10% is equally meaningful, in the log context). \n I wouldn\u2019t say modeling non-linearity is against the norms of the culture. \u00a0In fact, a failure to do so is something\u00a0quant experts consider an elementary flaw. \u00a0Its interesting that it nonetheless gets through peer review so often. \u00a0Even if modeling non-linearity is part of agreed upon best practices, it is interesting and important that, as Dan says, it often isn\u2019t done. \n The book also observes that quants, compared to quals, are more likely to emphasize between case variation as compared to within case variation. \u00a0I think there is something to this, but one of the things that distinguishes the most rigorous quantitative research is that it often capitalizes on within case variation from panel data. \n Keep in mind that I haven\u2019t read the book, so I\u2019m not sure the extent to which I\u2019m responding to Dan vs. responding to Goertz and Mahoney. \u00a0But regardless, you should go read Dan\u2019s review\u2026 its quite interesting."], "link": "http://permut.wordpress.com/2012/10/09/dan-reviews-goertz-mahoney-on-quant-vs-qual/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1, "http://asociologist.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Permutations"}, {"content": ["I love blogging about blogs, so let me point you to a new working paper entitled \u201cDo Political Blogs Matter? Corruption in State-Controlled Companies, Blog Postings, and DDoS Attacks.\u201d \u00a0I certainly like the idea that blogs can be tools to fight corruption. \u00a0But, and I say this as someone who hasn\u2019t read the paper, I don\u2019t know how much should we care about the result that online criticism caused very short-term changes in stock prices. \u00a0Perhaps Brayden King, with his interest in activism directed towards private companies, would have an interesting comment. \n \n The authors are economists, Ruben Enikolopov,\u00a0Maria Petrova, and\u00a0Konstantin Sonin. \u00a0The paper is here \u00a0and the abstract: \n Though new media has become a popular source of information, it is less clear whether or not they have a real impact on economic activity. In authoritarian regimes, where the traditional media are not free, this potential impact might be especially important. We study consequences of blog postings of a popular Russian anti-corruption blogger and shareholder activist Alexei Navalny on the stock prices of state-controlled companies. In an event-study analysis, we find a negative effect of company-related blog postings on both daily abnormal returns and within-day 5-minute returns. To cope with identification problem, we use the incidence of distributed denial-of-services (DDoS) attacks as a variable that negatively affects blog postings, but is uncorrelated with other determinants of asset prices. There is a substantial positive effect of the DDoS attacks on abnormal returns of the companies Navalny wrote about, and this effect is increasing in amount of his attention to these companies. The effect is decreasing in attention to posts of other top bloggers, increasing in visitors\u2019 attention to Navalny\u2019s posts, and is consistent with more pronounced individual, in contrast to institutional, trading. Finally, there are long-term effects of certain types of posts on stock returns, trading volume, and volatility. Overall, our evidence implies that blog postings about corruption in state-controlled companies have a negative causal impact on stock performance of these companies."], "link": "http://permut.wordpress.com/2012/10/01/new-media-matters/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://papers.ssrn.com/": 1, "http://feeds.wordpress.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Permutations"}, {"content": ["(cross-posted here ) \n I just completed Gabriel Rossman \u2018s Climbing the Charts: What Radio Airplay Tells Us about the Diffusion of Innovation . Basically the question at the heart of the book is what makes a song (or songs in general) popular? As with Fabio Rojas\u2019s take on it, I found the book really interesting, enjoyable to think through and useful to think with. He summarizes one aspect i especially liked about the book: \n Rossman has a simple, but powerful, idea. The different stories imply different diffusion curves (graphs that map market saturation vs. time). Each story comes with a different curve. The \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d story (hot songs diffuse through market networks) has a classical S-shaped curve. Promotion by the record industry has a discontinuous step function\u2026 \n I agree that\u2019s one of the particular strengths of the book. I also think it\u2019s readily teachable, and will likely make an appearance in a future iteration of intro and/or my undergrad networks class. I have only a couple of minor quibbles with it, which largely stem from my not being in the sociology of culture inner-circle, and may be readily apparent to those who are. \n First, an alternative that is not really discussed much at all is the perhaps obvious (strawman?) possibility that songs simply become popular because of their quality. I know that there\u2019s some work elsewhere (e.g., Matt Salganik\u2019s experiments ) to address this, and it may be a \u201csettled\u201d enough question in the literature, but i felt some treatment of it in the book would have helped the argument to stand a little more on its own (especially as i\u2019d like for teaching it). \n The other is even more minor, and perhaps even more about my ignorance than the book\u2019s shortcoming(s). Late in the book (see section 7.3) Rossman mentions how (1) limited potential bandwidth and (2) how the licensing process works in practice combine to make this in essence a closed, and relatively stable system (in terms of population boundaries). Perhaps this is a (so pervasive) detail that i should have known, but to be frank, i didn\u2019t really have an inkling of it until the closing pages of the book. This wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal, except that I was definitely reading this book more along the lines of the part of the title coming after the colon than the part before. That\u2019s to say that i was thinking throughout about what this case tells us generically about patterns of diffusion. As such, that we are working with a system with these characteristics is highly influential to what cases this one can (and can\u2019t) speak to, and how the particularities of what\u2019s being examined here may be constrained. As such, it\u2019s a detail i would have liked fleshed out (about as much as it was in the conclusions) a lot earlier. As it is i am left wanting to go back and rethink through some of the earlier ideas in the book with this tidbit in hand, assuming my understanding/interpretation/uses for some of the details in the previous models might be accordingly adjusted. \n Neither of these should be read as at all damning critiques of the book.

Basically, early in the process of working with this sort of data, I like to take a look at \u201cCitation Age\u201d information.** This gives a sense of how old the literature is that people are drawing on in a given time period. These often roughly follow linear increases (though the rate of \u201caging\u201d differs across fields). Anyway, \u00a0this one presented a couple of pretty extreme outliers (i\u2019ve done this more than just a couple of times, and haven\u2019t seen others this different). I can\u2019t account for them, so am looking for any potential explanations. \n Unfortunately the data isn\u2019t currently in a format that would let me actually \u201csolve\u201d what\u2019s accounting for this, but i should be able to soon, so it could be fun to see whose/which theories hold up. Anyway, if looking at this information by year, 1988 and 1991 are considerable outliers (see the plot after the jump). It would appear that most of the \u201cblip\u201d in 1988 comes from increased citations to work roughly 50 years before, while the one in 1991 comes from citations to work roughly 70 years earlier. Given that i\u2019m not a \u201cfull fledged\u201d demographer (training-wise), i\u2019m guessing others of you might be able to help me out here. What happened in 1988 that led people to suddenly read/cite work from the 1930s and from 1991 to suddenly read things from the 1920s***?

I\u2019m happy to quibble with this definition of the \u201cgeneral\u201d demography journals, and am definitely open to other suggestions. However, i think that\u2019s likely a slightly separate question. I did initially aim to also include Demographic Research, but ISI (my main data source) didn\u2019t start indexing that until 2005, so its considerable censoring made keeping it seem wonky. \n ** There are lots of different ways to compute \u201ccitation age\u201d and after discussing this more times than those who work with me on these things would like, we\u2019ve settled on typically using the option that basically depends on single cited-citing pairs contributing one observation (not a unique cited papers list, nor a citing paper-wise average).
