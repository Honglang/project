We wanted to understand how viewers use their smartphones and tablets as \u2018second screens\u2019 to research and fact-check topics during and after the debate. So we took a look at debate-related search queries coming from mobile devices on Tuesday and found that: \n Mobile has become a central component of this year\u2019s election: 2,000% increase in debate-related searches on mobile in 2012 vs. 2008 \n Mobile helps voters find spur-of-the-moment information: 3,300% increase in searches related to Libya immediately after the question about presidential accountability for the Benghazi attack \n Mobile is used simultaneously with television: 47% of Tuesday\u2019s elections-related mobile searches occurred during and immediately after the debate \n \n Mobile devices: our couch companions Already this election season, we\u2019re seeing voters research issues, find information, and even register to vote across desktop, smartphone, tablet and television. This data reinforces the need for political campaigns to engage voters across all four screens - especially during key campaign events. With the portability of mobile devices, many people are using them while watching television to search for follow-up information or to fact-check. The debates were a great example of this mobile multi-tasking as people turned to their mobile devices in real time to find more information about the comments and issues raised by the candidates. Looking at a timeline of searches for a specific issue like energy throughout the debate, we can see that the spikes in searches occur in direct response to specific conversation sparks on television. \n  \n (Click image above for larger version) \n \n Immediate information In addition to being used in front of the television, people turn to their mobile devices when they\u2019re looking for immediate information. The \u201calways-on\u201d nature of tablets and \u201calways with you\u201d nature of smartphones make them quick and easy to pick up for a spontaneous search. During the debate we saw enormous spikes in mobile queries immediately after panelist questions or statements from the candidates. For example, within one minute of Mary Fallano\u2019s question to Romney about his tax plan, tax-related mobile searches increased by over 500%. This is true not just while watching the debates, but also throughout the day as people use their smartphones while talking about politics with friends, listening to the news, or even after coming across an offline ad. Four screens to victory As we enter the final weeks of the presidential election, digital devices will be key to helping voters decide which candidate is right for them. It\u2019s a well-known fact that one of the keys to a successful candidacy is controlling the message. What\u2019s clear in today\u2019s multi-screen world, is that controlling the message on any issue requires that a candidate have a strategy to engage with voters across all four screens ."], "link": "http://googlepolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/8843765530441256739/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://1.blogspot.com/": 1, "http://www.google.com/": 2}, "blogtitle": "Politics & Elections Blog"}, {"content": ["Cross- Posted by Julie Hootkin VP, Global Strategy Group and Robert Blizzard VP, Public Opinion Strategies \n \n [From time to time we invite guests to blog about initiatives of interest, and are very pleased to have Julie Hootkin of Global Strategy Group and Robert Blizzard of Public Opinion Strategies join us here. \u2013 Ed.] \n \n \n \n \nAs the 2012 campaign enters its final weeks, new research suggests that the Internet offers candidates a real opportunity to reach the most sought-after voters \u2013 those who have not yet made up their minds.

With all 435 seats up for election in brand new Congressional Districts this November , that adage rings even more true for House candidates running this fall. Through the redistricting process that takes place every 10 years, every district takes on a new shape - with new voters. This makes reaching the right voters with the right message even tougher. \n \nStarting today, in addition to targeting specific zip codes , we\u2019re enabling an even more useful solution that allows political campaigns to reach voters within a specific Congressional District. \n \nSay you are running for Congress in the 6th District of Maryland - which features a highly publicized race between Ten-term incumbent Rep. Roscoe Bartlett and Montgomery County businessman John Delaney. The 6th is located in western Maryland, and has been a longtime GOP stronghold, but was drastically reshaped by redistricting which has made it more competitive. \n \nBarlett and Delaney\u2019s campaigns are waging a battle in the oddly shaped district that has voters in many zip codes, towns and communities looks like this: \n \n \n(This map embedded above is courtesy of data from Azavea ) \n \nAs campaigns know, reaching these households in an effective manner with traditional means takes time and - importantly - valuable resources. This district is a great example - it includes voters who live in the Washington D.C. media market. But, as you can see from the map, buying TV ads in DC won\u2019t reach your voters in the 6th District. \n \nNow, with congressional district targeting in AdWords, campaigns can quickly and easily target their search, display, mobile and video ads *solely* within that particular district\u2019s border. You can start by heading into AdWords and selecting your District number from the location menu populated with district information in simple Google Maps format, prepared by Azavea . Build your ad and you\u2019re on your way. \n \n \n \nWe\u2019ve built a sizeable team that is working around the clock to help all candidates get the most from their online advertising efforts. Congressional District Targeting in AdWords is just one more way that we\u2019re working hard to deliver better ads for users and voters and better tools for political campaigns. \n \nBy working across all four screens , digital ads are highly accountable, precise, and continually evolving.

But this year that's started to change. The most sophisticated campaigns are investing earlier....Now those of you political insiders know that there's some precedent here: Paul Begala hangs part of Clinton's '96 victory on the campaign's ability to define Dole early, Karl Rove and company successfully deployed this strategy against John Kerry, and the Obama campaign has been seemingly operating out of the same playbook, attempting to define Mitt Romney in an ad blitz that began last April. But the levels of early spending this cycle are unprecedented. And with good reason. \n \nThe latest research points out that voter influence starts early: 44% of voters saying they research candidates and issues more than four months out from Election Day (Shopper Sciences). And search query data backs this up. \n \nIn 2008, we saw that over 60% of searches on policy-related terms for President Obama (like \u201cObama policies\u201d and \u201cObama economic plan\u201d) came well ahead of Election Day and before October 1st. While some of the spikes are attributable to the primary with Hillary Clinton, the steady baseline of Obama searches indicates that voters were researching, learning, and making up their minds' about the candidate long before October. \n \n \n \n  \n*Google Internal Data \n \nAnd this isn\u2019t just on a national level; the trend is also strong in the states. The 2008 Franken/Coleman Senate race in Minnesota was one of the hottest in the country and voters also got started early in their research. Fully 70% of searches on the candidates\u2019 names came before October 1st. \n \nThis cycle, early searching has been dramatically higher than the 2008 race. Searches for Governor Romney from June 27, 2011 - July 15, 2012 are three times higher than searches for Senator McCain in the same period four years ago--a sign that Obama and his allies are attempting to capitalize on in their move to define their opponent early, when many voters are making their initial assessments. \n \n \n \n  \nMcCain data: June 25, 2007 - July 13, 2008 \nRomney data: June 27, 2011 - July 15, 2012 \n*Google Internal Data   Investing early is a growing trend in other industries as well - most notably in the retail space where stores are opening their doors and upping their promotions well in advance of Black Friday. And guess what? 34% of people now start their holiday shopping before October (Shopper Sciences). Take two other monumental events this year - the Super Bowl and the Olympics. Pre-released Super Bowl spots from Chevy and VW scored millions of views on YouTube in advance of game day while Visa and Coke Olympics campaigns topped the Ad Age viral video chart in May -- a full 3 months before the summer games. \n \nWhy does it pay to be an early mover? For starters, it\u2019s easier to break through. According to Politico, the 2012 cycle may go down in history as the most cluttered and expensive. Reaching engaged voters when they\u2019re researching candidates, reading up on issues and forming opinions early just makes sense. Finally, you get more bang for your buck earlier. On average cost-per-view for Youtube TrueView advertising increased 267% in the 2010 Cycle in October 27 - November 2 compared to the three months prior. \n \nHere are a few simple strategies to buy more efficiently and make an early investment count over time: \n \n 1. Capture the attention of early searchers by starting early \nWhen voters are looking for information on candidates or important issues, search is the first place they turn. Help them find you fast by making your message stand out via search ads and then convert their interest into signups, volunteer hours, and donations. And with mobile search traffic on candidates skyrocketing from less than 1% of total queries in January 2008 to at least a quarter today, make sure you have a mobile-optimized website that makes it easy for smartphone and tablet users to connect with you. \n \n \n \n  \n*Google Internal Data \n \n 2. Complement your TV buy with online and mobile video \nWith 45% of likely voters nationwide saying that live TV isn\u2019t their primary mode of consuming video (Shopper Sciences, April 2011), a multi-screen strategy is a must-have for a successful campaign. Online and mobile video not only extend a TV campaign message more efficiently over time, but deliver unique creative solutions like interactive video ads that can transform your campaign messages into engaging experiences to persuade voters. \n \n 3. Speak to key audiences continuously with targeted display advertising \nYou know who your key voters are, and targeted display ads are efficient enough that you can go up early and never come down. Whether you want to reach suburban moms, NASCAR dads or Hispanics, targeted display advertising lets you communicate continuously with your key audiences, wherever they are. Reaching your primary audiences in the right moments over time and across devices is an effective way to drive awareness, engagement and voter preference. \n \n 4. Remarket to engaged users \nRemarketing lets you continuously re-engage people who previously visited your website or watched your online video. For example, you can tailor messaging specifically to those who may have visited an action page of your candidate\u2019s website, but didn\u2019t sign up or donate. Whether you\u2019re looking to raise money, solicit volunteers or any other goal, remarketing should be a strategic component of every campaign. \n \n 5. Use social extensions to boost your search performance and discoverability \nStart early and build your campaign\u2019s social marketing efforts by sharing social annotations like +1 buttons between your ads and social network pages. This feature helps build a larger collection of social recommendations that improves ad performance. Ads displaying a +1 annotation have seen clickthrough rate uplifts of 5%-10% (Google Internal Data, 2012) \n \n Posted by Jennifer Gross, Google Politics & Elections Team"], "link": "http://googlepolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/1126584397789698125/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.google.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Politics & Elections Blog"}, {"content": ["Almost 20% of the US population speaks Spanish and as we get closer to Election Day access to information about candidates and important issues will be in high demand.

The Super Bowl stands out as the most important event for marketers, with roughly $230 million spent on game day from brands like Pepsico, Anheuser Busch and General Motors. The stakes for both events are incredibly high. \n \nCan we learn from and apply techniques from one of those massive events to the other? Specifically, we thought it would be interesting to examine if political campaigns can learn anything from approaching Election Day from the same perspective that big brand marketers have used ahead of the big game. We found that savvy marketers who started early produced results for the Super Bowl and smart political campaigns can have an impact in the same way. \n \nAhead of this year\u2019s Super Bowl, some of the top spenders tried to break free of the noise during the game. They took marketing in a new direction and pre-released their \u201ctelevision\u201d commercials online prior to game day. Honda CRV, for example, released a teaser video that was a recreation of Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off taking an adventure in his Honda CRV. The video, released on YouTube more than a week before the game, received over 5 million views in just one week, as well as attention from numerous press outlets leading up to the big game. \n \n \n \n \n \nOther brands like Chevrolet, MetLife, Volkswagen and E-Trade also leveraged the benefits of greater awareness, intrigue and \u201ctalk value\u201d from promoting their content online well in advance of game day. While they may have given up the \u201csurprise factor\u201d of unveiling their new ads on the big screen on February 5th, it appears that they gained a lot more. These early releases online made it easier for viewers to form opinions ahead of time in a less cluttered environment, and - importantly - then share and discuss them within their friends, family, and co-workers. The multi-screen effect provided more engagement opportunities with the brand - allowing viewers to view, vote, comment and \u201clike\u201d ads online or via mobile devices. \n \nWhile the Elections advertising cycle is much longer than the Super Bowl, the value of starting early still applies. Here are three ways your campaign can benefit from a pre-Labor Day advertising investment across four screens (television, computers, tablets and mobile phones): \n \n Preview key messages to maximize impact \nLet\u2019s face it: for campaigns, November is incredibly noisy. By the time these elections are upon us, most of us (political nuts aside) are a bit sick of seeing all the political ads and messages. Between TV commercials, direct mail, and online ads, campaigns are bombarding voters right up to the voting booth. Thus, taking a page from the corporate marketer\u2019s playbook, beginning your campaign investment early not only allows your message to break through with greater ease, but empowers voters to engage with your content. \n \nThe Roger Williams for U.S. Congress Committee successfully drove campaign awareness, donations and earned media beginning in June 2011 for the 2012 election cycle. The Committee promoted issue-oriented video ads on YouTube, along with overlays that drove viewers to a specialized donation landing page. One such video, \"The Donkey Whisperer\" , which draws humorous parallels between Democrats and Williams\u2019 hungry donkeys, received 50,000 views in the first 48 hours and considerable attention from bloggers and traditional media outlets. Separating your candidate or issue from the pack can turn passive viewing in a noisy environment into active viewing in a less cluttered environment. \n \n Marry offline and online \nTelevision ads alone are not enough to reach voters. Today, an ad is a stimulus, and people respond immediately by searching for more information. In fact, in a survey of likely South Carolina Republican primary voters, 60% who searched online after seeing an advertisement used a search engine to check information about a candidate (POS/Google Study, 2012). \n \nFurthermore, campaigns that run across screens have 24% greater recall and 17% greater engagement than those on a single screen (Nielsen Multi-Screen Lab Study, 2011) so you want to deliver your message over time to reach and influence voters on all the media sources they consume -- from watching television, reading articles online and using mobile applications. \n \n Get bang for your buck \nBuying early lets you maximize your campaign budget in two important ways. First, prices are much lower May through August so you\u2019re able to reach the same audience much more efficiently. Second, reservable inventory is not always available as it gets closer to the election, especially in battleground states. If you don\u2019t already have your budget allocated, start now with a strategy that allows you to begin early and then scale where and when it\u2019s right for your campaign. Don\u2019t wait until the last minute when inventory is depleted. Finally, take advantage of the efficiencies of buying media across multiple screens. \n \nMany Super Bowl 2012 advertisers made the web work in a bigger way a by sharing content with viewers across screens ahead of game day. By expanding their single :30 second television moment to new online moments, they drew more viewers to their content and peaked interest earlier. Candidates - at all levels - have the same ability to take advantage to win the moments that matter much earlier in the cycle to score more votes at \u201cgame time.\u201d \n \n \n \n * Figure based on 2008 turnout data. \n \n \n \n Posted by Jennifer Gross, Google Politics & Elections Team"], "link": "http://googlepolitics.blogspot.com/feeds/7203433603715891641/comments/default", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.youtube.com/": 2, "http://www.google.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Politics & Elections Blog"}, {"content": ["The lengthy and tense redistricting process is finally wrapping up, but anyone wanting a national map of congressional districts faces the tedious task of compiling them from each state \u2014 until now!

For campaigns and candidates, that means that the because of the Internet access to relevant political information no longer comes from one place--or one screen.
