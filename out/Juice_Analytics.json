The reporting or analytics is often just a table with lots of filtering features. That doesn\u2019t begin to answer important questions like: \n \n What is the value of the pipeline? \n Where is it performing efficiently? Where is it failing? \n How are things likely to change in the next month? \n \n I\u2019ve been annoyed by this deficiency in sales dashboards for a while. Ken and I put together some thoughts about what a better sales pipeline information interface would look like and how it would function. Here\u2019s what we came up with: \n  \n The dashboard flows from top to bottom and has five main parts: \n \n Question-based navigation; \n Filters to narrow the scope of your analysis; \n Summary metrics built around the stages of your sales pipeline; \n Top (or bottom) performers visualization to emphasize what factors are driving success (or failure); \n Detailed table showing individual leads or deals. \n \n Let\u2019s look at some of these pieces in a bit more detail: \n  \nZooming into the top section, we\u2019d want to direct users to key and common questions. Once selected, the question would configure elements in the dashboard (primarily the sales pipeline key metrics) to lead the user to answers. For expert users, these questions could act like customized short-cuts. Novice users get help focusing on the important issues and can learn from best-practices. \n  \nThe top performers visualization highlights the factors that are most aligned with success of the pipeline. These factors may be the product being sold, the sales representative who is selling it, or the source of the lead. The vertical position of each top item is based on the selected key metrics.\u00a0The same visualization could be flipped around to show the characteristics that are leading to the poorest performance. \n  \nFinally, selecting elements in the visualization would refine the data in the table of deals/leads at the bottom to give the user to the specific items to act on. \n By no means is this a perfect and comprehensive dashboard for sales data. But I haven\u2019t seen anything as directed and functional.\u00a0If you have, I\u2019d love to see it. \n Update: I just came across InsightSquared , and like some of the views they offer for sales data (e.g.\u00a0 sales pipeline visualization ,\u00a0 sales trending )"], "link": "http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/designing-a-better-sales-pipeline-dashboard/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.salesforce.com": 1, "http://www.pipelinedeals.com": 1, "http://highrisehq.com/": 1, "http://www.insightsquared.com/": 3, "http://www.juiceanalytics.com/": 4}, "blogtitle": "Juice Analytics"}, {"content": ["Conventional \n \n 4-door sedan \n \n Financial spreadsheet \n \n Old-school conference \n \n \n \n Un-conventional \n \n Tesla Model S \n \n Interactive model \n \n Product Camp un-conference \n \n \n \n Juice isn\u2019t known for doing things in traditional ways.

So, when we had the opportunity to sponsor the 2012 Atlanta Product Camp un-conference, we knew we had to get involved. \n  \n If you\u2019re not familiar with Product Camp, it\u2019s based on the barcamp un-conference model where people who are interested in a particular concept come together and decide right then and there what sessions they think should occupy the day.

With the score still lit up on the wooden scoreboard, the coaches yelled to the boys as they struggled to lift their heads so they might catch a glimpse of a rainbow as it rose from the fence in front of them. \n The players of both the winning and losing teams stood there on the wet, steamy grass, frozen in place, in awe of the sight of a rainbow that mystically appeared as if painted on the sky just for them to see. For them, it was an atta boy, pat on the back, a perfect way to wrap up a hard fought double header in which the score had not quite represented the effort that the losing team had given, where the stats failed to tell the tale that brought these two teams together on the hallowed Cooperstown soil. \n \n That\u2019s the thing about numbers. When left to their own devices, they can feel as cold as digits on a lonely scoreboard. They say nothing of the teams who trained for months, played together game after game, relinquished their Saturdays and played nearly perfect seasons just to get to the tournament. \n Numbers alone tell us nothing of context. When we have something particularly meaningful to say, images help us share it best. Dashboards and data visualizations bring to life presentations in which we can engage in two-way conversations with our audience making the story around our data more memorable , impactful and effective than any spreadsheet or table of numbers we can put in front of them. \n What will your audience remember? The numbers, the final score?

Then we build tools to make those conversations more productive. \n One interesting conversation for us is the one that occurs between start-up founders and investors. Due to the sensitivity involved, its extra important that both sides have a shared view of company valuation and projections. After seeing this conversation play out with spreadsheets and PowerPoint slides, we thought it could be a lot more productive if there was a simple, interactive tool to explore scenarios. \n If you\u2019re thinking about taking investment or talking to investors, our company valuation tool let\u2019s you to test different assumptions and the see the financial results. Here\u2019s how it works: \n  \n 1. Set pre-investment assumptions . Input how much the company is worth before an investment and how much investment you are looking for. \n 2. Add assumptions about revenue and/or profit growth . Choose the number of years for your projection, then drag the trend lines to reflect your model for growth. \n 3. Choose valuation model . Do you want to set a valuation based on revenues or EBITDA? You\u2019ll need to adjust the appropriate multiple. \n As an extra bonus, we have a feature to see what the valuation scenario means for the current owners of the company. Turn\u00a0the owner valuation toggle to \u201con\u201d in the upper right corner. \n We also have a short video of the tool in action. \n There you have it: a simple tool for considering company valuation scenarios. We\u2019ll be the first to admit that the valuation model is relatively straightforward. There is no support for liquidation preference, complex pre-investment financing structures, option pools, or how to repay your mom\u2019s loan.

Have you ever been in a \u201cconversation\u201d with someone and they talk 90% of the time. They ask you a question and while you\u2019re 15 seconds into answering they interrupt and starting offloading their mountains of insight. It\u2019s mostly about them. And their consideration for you? Not so much. \n That is what most dashboards do. Blah, blah, blah. What if\u2026 \n What if the information presentations we interacted with actually acknowledged who they\u2019re talking to, listened more, and talked less? What if\u00a0we were to replace the focus on data with a conversation and a way of working out the complexities of data between two or more people. \n To do this properly, think about what a \u201cgood conversation\u201d is. Here are a few characteristics we came up with: \n \n The people have similar experience around a topic ; so they know what they\u2019re talking about, but because every person is unique, they\u2019ve gathered unique insight that can be shared. The varying, educated perspective keeps the conversation interesting. \n The one doesn\u2019t overly interrupt the other . Sure there may be reasons to interrupt here and there, but, if interruption is the norm, it quickly gets as annoying (and rude) as your cable news political analyst. \n There is a sense of genuine care for what the other person is saying because, well\u2026 there is a genuine sense for what the other person is saying. Too often people get caught up in the \u201ctricks\u201d of networking and small talk and \u201cthe hook.\u201d What if people actually respond to what\u2019s genuine? \n Distractions are minimal . One person isn\u2019t constantly checking their phone or entertaining other interests . People are very adept at sensing interest. They do this by reading you: body language, eyes, word usage, how you breathe, pace of speech, and inflection to name a few. If you are actually interested in hearing what another else has to say, they will know. \n You trust the other person . There is an assumed authenticity about each other. This is slow to build and easy to break. \n \n So there\u2019s a few qualities of good conversation, but why? People don\u2019t often stop to think about why they enjoy good conversation. Let\u2019s look at the benefits: \n \n Your perspective is sharpened . You don\u2019t have to live through the same experience the other person did in order to benefit from their insight. That is, if you trust what they are saying. This is a big time saver! Imagine if no one acted on anything but personally experienced information. You may know some people like that. They flounder, spending more time re-discovering rather than benefiting. \n Your momentum is accelerated .\u00a0Good conversations with trustworthy friends or experts is one of the biggest ways we overcome obstacles and keep momentum in life. \n A dependable relationship is formed . You know if you ever want to talk about \u201cx\u201d topic again, where to turn. As the trust is built in that conversation, you are also setting this person as someone you can turn for solid footing when future steps are required. \n Great conversations\u00a0 lighten your burden . Joking isn\u2019t trivial, in fact, some the most serious conversations benefit from humor. It promotes an open mind and releases misplaced pressure over circumstances. \n \n Now, why is a designer at a visualization, dashboarding, software company talking about all these warm fuzzies?! Presenting information is about people. We\u2019re adamant about that at Juice. We\u2019ve been focusing on what people actually want out of their data for a long time. Why? Because it\u2019s a hole in the market and it\u2019s fundamental to knowing what people both need and want to see out of \u201cinformation experiences\u201d they encounter.\u00a0Until we appreciate the qualities and benefits of good conversations, we don\u2019t have a firm foundation for sharing and communicating data. \n You\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, that\u2019s all fine and good, but how in the world does this play out in an application or dashboard?.\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked. This concept is something of deep interest at Juice and the thoughts here represent the tip of the iceberg. As we actively work through these concepts, we\u2019ll look to provide practical examples in the coming months. \n Questions \n What are some of the qualities of an enjoyable conversation you\u2019ve had this week? \nHow did it affect your day? \nIn what ways could you imagine your dashboard just talking and not listening? \n Dig Deeper \n This talk by John Cleese (of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus) is one of the best on creativity I\u2019ve ever seen, and it speaks to the seriousness of humor, for the jokesters among you. \n Evaluate and apply some related design principles to your application: Make it conversational , Use common language , Consider data comfort and expertise ."], "link": "http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/dashboards-talk-too-much/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.juiceanalytics.com/": 3, "http://www.youtube.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Juice Analytics"}, {"content": ["(A conversation about data) \n The other day my seven year old asked, \u201cHow do you say indigo in Japanese?\u201d I said, \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d His response: \u201cJust curious.\u201d \n I love every interaction with my kids, but especially the ones where they surprise me.

The conversation that surrounds a question is as important as the question itself. Both have context, a set of relevant questions and hopefully a little curiosity. You would think that because of the similarities between data and conversations, that a conversation about data would be easy. Unfortunately, not so much. Every day we see folks wrestling with how to have a conversation about their data. \n Think about it. How many \u201cdata-based\u201d conversations have you sat through that are REALLY overstuffed Power Point presentations, metric-filled reports or chart-engorged dashboards? Not a conversation, but more like an annoying advertisement. People are so afraid of \u201cThe Indigo Question\u201d, that they try to answer EVERY possible question by pommelling their audience with lots and lots of data or worse, innumerable slides. \n How about trying this: communicate with data by thinking of it in the context of a conversation: Ask questions; listen to answers; don\u2019t try to cast the conversation before it happens, but allow it to form as it takes place. \n Start with understanding the questions that your audience will want to know about your data: \n \n How has number of bench presses for defensive tackles changed over time? \n Where are my sales coming from? \n Do field goal attempts drive total points per game? \n \n The questions give you great insight into how you would want to show the results. For instance, \n Changes over time are shown by trend lines, \n  \n comparisons can be shown with distributions, \n  \n and outliers might be revealed in a bubble chart. \n  \n In the coming months you\u2019ll hear more about the concept of a conversation with data from us.\u00a0In fact, turning spreadsheets into conversations is something we think can be a transformational way to think about your data. \n So, after my son and I got home from running errands that day, we went to Google translate to figure out \u201cHow do you say Indigo in Japanese?\u201d:\u00a0 http://translate.google.com/#auto|ja|indigo .\u00a0This then led us to wonder when would a Japanese person talk about the color indigo or the Indigo plant? \u00a0By afternoon both of us walked away from the conversation feeling like we had learned a bunch, cherishing the time spent and looking forward to the next conversation. \u00a0After all, isn\u2019t that what we hope to achieve with all our conversations: to feel that sense of reward that makes us anxiously await the next one? \n Here\u2019s to great data conversations!"], "link": "http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/dad-how-do-you-say-indigo-in-japanese/", "bloglinks": {}, "links": {"http://www.juiceanalytics.com/": 4, "http://translate.google.com/": 1}, "blogtitle": "Juice Analytics"}]
