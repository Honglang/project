The following explanation is intentionally detailed and 'repetitious'. \n \nThe prob of a 6 on each roll is 1/6. Each roll produces only 2 outcomes, either a 6 (prob=1/6) or not a 6 (prob = 5/6). \n \nThe prob of a 7 on each roll of a pair of dice is 6/36 or 1/6. Each roll of the pair has only 2 outcomes, either a 7 (prob=1/6) or not a 7 (prob=5/6). \n \nTherefore, the probabilities of getting 3 successes in 5 trials is the same. Since the question asks for a comparison, we're done. \n \nThe actual prob is C(5,3)(1/6)^3\u2022(5/6)^2 where C(5,3) is the 'MathNotation' for the number of ways of arranging 5 objects, one group of 3 identical objects and a separate group of 2 identical objects.

Compute mentally - 30 seconds tick tick tick... \n  \n I'm being silly with the ticking clock but it is possible to do this if you choose the \"right\" base! Unless of course you can mentally apply Heron's formula which is doable! Ok, so there's more than one way as always! \n \nSo what makes it special!? Somebody out there knows... \n \n If you like these challenges consider purchasing my new Math Challenge Problem/Quiz Book - 175 questions - SAT format - with answers.
