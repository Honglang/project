 * Basic stuff
   x add titles of blogs to the labels (tried adding attr to networkx graph, gml didn't like it) - completed
   x try scraping the front page of each of the blogs for blogroll links - need to add replacements to title strings so they can be valid files
     (I tried this, and didn't get anything very interesting)
   x complete manual blogroll process (start with allendowney.blogspot.com)
 * Implement the NLP stuff
   x create term document matrix
   x convert to tf-idf
   * maybe make the similarity more efficient
   * cluster blogs based on similarity (review Programming Collective Intelligence)
   * fancier stuff (nice to have): named entity extraction
 * Implement the SNA stuff
   x build graph
   x display it
   x pickle the graph for further exploration in networkx
   * analyze it
 * Compare the two
   * maybe add topic clusters as attributes? that way Gephi can color them (would be nice)
   * try k-means on similarity, and compute how often the clustering and community detection agree that pairs are in same group
     use Spearman's r, or something like that
 * Efficiency
   * Normalize TF-IDF vectors before analyzing them.
